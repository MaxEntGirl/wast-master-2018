Dear Gilbert,
I'm coming to London on Thursday Dec. 8th & leaving on Friday morning. I cann't come on a weekend This time as I've got to be in Bern on Saturday to see Marguerite who has her only free afternoon that day. Now there are many questions to be asked & answered:
a) can you spend Thursday evening with me? (I say 'evening' as I suppose you aren't free in the afternoon?)
b) can you get me a french transit visa. I don't go through Belgium. I thing the french embassy is somewhere near Gordon square. If you can give my love to the embassadors wife. They always like it.
c) Will you be so kind and answer the questions a & b immediately?
d) Will you accept my kindest regards & my bloodiest greetings?
Ludwig
P.S. I'm much better.
P.P.S. As to meeting in London: I shall be getting there sometime in the morning or about noon. So please suggest a time & place.
P.P.P.S The address of the french embacy is
51 Bedford Square
W.C. I
This doesnt mean 'Lavatory'
