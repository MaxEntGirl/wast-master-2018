My dear Roland,
I have to give you very terrible news.
Francis fell ill four days ago with poliomyelitis & died yesterday morning. He died without any pain or struggle entirely peacefully. I was with him. I think he has had one of the happiest lives I've known anyone to have, & also the most peaceful death.
I wish you good & kind thoughts.
As always
Ludwig
