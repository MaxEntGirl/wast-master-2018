Dear Professor von Wright,
Thank you for your letter of Feb. 14th. My lectures vary a great deal. They are sometimes satisfactory, sometimes very unsatisfactory. My mind, for reasons I don't know, often feels very exhausted. (I am, by the way, in perfectly good health.) This equilibrium of mine is so labile that, before long, my lectures may become hopelessly inadequate & that, after a struggle, I may have to give up teaching. Why do I write you all this? Because, if I should feel sterile & exhausted next Easter Term, I'ld ask you not to come to my classes; for your presence, in that case, might make things more difficult for me. Otherwise I shall be glad if you will attend.
I'm glad that you are going to lecture here, & I know that by attending your lectures I could learn a very great deal. In spite of this I will not come to them ‒ for the sole reason that, in order to live & to work, I have to allow no import of foreign goods (i.e., philosophical ones) into my mind. For the same reason I haven't read your book, though I am convinced of it's excellence. If you think that I'm getting old ‒ you're right. So long! & good luck!
Yours sincerely,
Ludwig Wittgenstein
