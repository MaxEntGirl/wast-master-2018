Dear Rowland,
Thanks a lot for the nice detective story. I was in need of one just when it arrived. I can't write anything about myself, except that, after some months of excellent health, I'm feeling rather lousy these days, though I don't know what is the matter with me & perhaps it's just nerves. Still it worries me as it interferes with my University work.
Lots of good wishes!
Ludwig
