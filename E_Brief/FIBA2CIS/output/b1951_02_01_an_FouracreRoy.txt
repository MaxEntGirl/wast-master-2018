Dear Roy,
Thanks for your letter. I'm sorry there's been illness in your family. I hope you won't get the flu'; there's a regular epidemic here. ‒ I have been ill for quite a long time, about 6 weeks, & have to spend part of the day in bed. I don't know when I'll be able to come to London again. If there's no chance of it I'll let you know & you might be able to visit me here on a Sunday some time. ‒ I'm glad to hear that all my statues have been pulled down, as long as it wasn't done in any disrespectful way!
I'm sorry to hear that you are so rushed. Let other hospitals make their own stuff. ‒ If you see Miss Wilkinson give her, my good wishes. Bless you!
As usual
Ludwig
