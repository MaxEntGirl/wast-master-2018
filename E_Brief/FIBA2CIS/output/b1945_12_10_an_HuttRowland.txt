Dear Roland,
Of course I'm willing. I hope you'll be lucky. Behave well, & if you make enemies don't do it by careless behaviour. ‒ Please do me a favour. Write to your friend Collingwood that I have sent him a parcel with 300 cigarettes. I have written him, too, but it's just possible that he mightn't get my letter as I enclosed a letter to my Vienese friend, written in German. I will close now as I'm in a hurry.
All Good wishes!
Ludwig
