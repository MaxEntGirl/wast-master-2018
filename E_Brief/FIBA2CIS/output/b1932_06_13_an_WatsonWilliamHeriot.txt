My dear Watson,
Thanks so much for your letter and the cutting. Yes, I believe Einstein is just a bloody journalist – I was glad to hear that you’ve got a little animal and hope he’s doing well. I’ve had a very busy term, doing lots of work and seeing pupils. But my work progresses very slowly for it’s such a huge job and I’m not equal to it. – What you wrote about your boss interested me very much, it’s such a typical thing to happen nowadays to otherwise good and kind people.
I wish I could come over some time and see you and have discussions and conversations with you.
Yours ever
Ludwig Wittgenstein
