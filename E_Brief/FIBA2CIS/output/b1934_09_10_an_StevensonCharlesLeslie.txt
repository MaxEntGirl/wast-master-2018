Dear Stevenson,
Thanks so much for your letter, dated June 5th. I'm glad you passed your written exams & I'm sure you did well in your oral ones as well. I hope you'll enjoy teaching; but if you're any good at it I think your enjoiment will be kept down somewhat by the discovery of how enormously difficult it is to get clear enough about a thing to be able to explain it to another man without cheating him & yourself. I mean that if you don't find it overwhelmingly difficult to teach phoilosophy you won't be much good at it. For I imagine that "rock-bottom honesty", as you call it, is damn difficult to acquire.
As to "bringing your own fragmentary ideas into something like a coherent order", I thought there would be time enough for that when you were 60. I thought it would be heaps if you could write a few decent fragments. One day you'll see that this is true. ‒ Last academic year was a great strain but I've taken a good rest now for almost a month & so ought to be able to do some work again soon. I've been to Austria for 6 weeks & come back here a week ago. In a few days I shall be going to Ireland to stay a fortnight with Drury whom I suppose you'll remember. Then I shall come back here for good. I wonder what my class will be like & what my own head will be like. ‒ Miss Ambrose has got a research scholarship for the next year. She has been doing very well indeed.
Please remember me to Mrs Stevenson & to Cooley if you see him.
Yours very sincerely
Ludwig Wittgenstein
Let me hear from you again before long.
