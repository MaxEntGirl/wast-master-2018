Dear Sraffa,
Thank you for the Listener. Rhine is one of those people who would make me feel sceptical about the law of gravitation if he told me about it. He isn’t quite concentrated enough, however, to be very amusing. If you meet him, please tell him that, if he wants to get into my collection of nonsense, he’ll have to compress his rubbish a little more. Still – one mustn’t be ungrateful.
I wanted to see you again before leaving Cambridge, but it wasn’t possible. I hope to see you again.
Yours, 
Ludwig Wittgenstein
