Dear Mr Butler,
Thanks for your letter, dated October 24. I will not communicate with Prof. Pribram about a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation & have explained my reasons for not doing so to Mr. Priestley. He has been so kind to promise me that he would explain them to you in case you should want to know them, as I would find great difficulties in explaining them to you personally.
Yours sincerely
L Wittgenstein
