Dear Ogden!
I wrote to you the other day as an answer to your P.C. addressed to Puchberg. Just now I got the kard forwarded from Hasbach. I got the meaning of meaning & the M. Guardian. I have not heard from Keynes & haven't got the Times you mention. My address is: Puchberg am Schneeberg Nieder-Österreich, Austria.
Fröhliche Ostern!
Yours sincerely
L. Wittgenstein
Did Keynes write to me? If so, please tell him it hasn't reached me.
