Text: 
Thursday
Dear Gilbert,
Listen!: ‒ I shall probably come to London on Thursday March 16th, because Drury who now is in S. Wales wants to see me & proposed to come to London & meet me there. He would leave from Paddington at about 6 p.m.. Could I then meet you somewhere or other between 6 & 7 & have supper with you? I should then go back to Cambridge at about 10 p.m. & come back to London two days later on Saturday (18th) & leave for Vienna on Sunday morning & I want, if possible, to spent Saturday afternoon with you, going through all the ritual meals etc. etc.. Will this suit you? Please let me know at once.
It might interest you to hear that I've had a slight accident & broke a rib. I thought of having it removed & of having a wife made of it, but they tell me that the art of making women out of ribs has been lost. ‒ 
Bloodily yours
Ludwig
