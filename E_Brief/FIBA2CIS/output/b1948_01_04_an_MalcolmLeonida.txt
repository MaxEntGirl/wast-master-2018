Dear Lee,
Thank you for your very nice letter. I'm a much worse correspondent than you are. I spent Christmas alone here, but on Boxing Day I saw two friends, one of whom had come over from England to see me & stayed with me here for a few days. ‒ This is a pretty quiet place, & if it were still more quiet it would suit me still better. My work's going moderately well & I think it might even go very well if I weren't suffering from some kind of indigestion which I don't seem to be able to shake off. I'll have to come to Ithaca & eat your good cooking. ‒ Actually it's gradually getting better, & my landlady here gives me all I need. ‒ I was a bit worried by what you write about Norman, that he's working so d... hard. Please tell him from me not to overdo it. I seriously admire his energy; but a man can only do so much. ‒ Your lovely present has arrived. Thanks a lot! I'll now have enough to read for a whole year.
I think it's a very good idea to make Ray read to you. To practice reading aloud well, i.e. carefully, teaches one a lot! E.g. how rotten & slapdash most people, & the newpapers, write; & they write as they think. I'm sure horses won't be bad company for Ray.
I heard from Shah & Kreisel & Hijab & Hunt. Shah & a few other students are having regular discussions in Shah's room, & apparently they aren't too bad, & some of the Moral Science Club meetings at which no Dons are present are tolerable, too.
I very much hope that some day I'll be able to be with you again & to have talks with Norman.
My love to all of you! & thanks again.
Ludwig
P.S. I've never heard of Rosenthal, which means nothing.
