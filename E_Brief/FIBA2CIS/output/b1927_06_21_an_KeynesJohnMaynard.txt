My dear Keynes,
It's ages since you have heard from me. I haven't even thanked you for your little book about Russia which you sent me about a year & a half ago. I won't try to explain my long silence: there were lots of reasons for it. I had a great many troubles one overlapping the other & postponed writing untill they would be all over. But now I have interrupted my troubles by a short holyday & this is the occasion to write to you. I have given up teaching long ago (about 14 month)* & have taken to architecture. I'm building a house in Vienna. This gives me heaps of troubles & I'm not even sure that I'm not going to make a mess of it. However I believe it will be finished about November & then I might take a trip to England if anybody there should care to see me. I should very much like to see you again & meanwhile to get a line from you.
About your book I forgot to say that I liked it. It shows that you know that there are more things between heave[n] & earth etc.
Please remember me to your wife.
Yours ever
Ludwig
