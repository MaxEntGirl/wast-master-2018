Dear v. Wright,
Thanks for several letters. I'm sorry I didn't write before now. In Norway there was for a time a lot of trouble: Ben Richards fell ill twice with asthma & bronchitis. In spite of all this we enjoyed our stay enormously. We had excellent weather the whole time & were surrounded by the greatest kindness. I decided then & there that I'd return to Norway to work there. I get no real quiet here. If all goes well I shall sail on Dec. 30th & go to Skjolden again. I don't think I'll be able to stay in my hut because the physical work I've got to do there is to heavy for me, but an old friend told me that she'd let me stay at her farmhouse. Of course I don't know whether I'm able any more to do decent work, but at least I'm giving myself a real chance. If I can't work there I can't work anywhere. By the way, I'd rather you didn't talk about that plan of mine just yet. â€’ I had a letter from Malcolm a few days ago in which he asks me to remember him to you.
Please give Mrs v. Wright & her mother my very kind regards, & to Eva, too, if she is with you.
Good wishes!
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
