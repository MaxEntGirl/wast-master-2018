Dear Norman,
Thank you for two letters, or rather a letter & a X-mas card. I was very pleased to get them. I have only today moved into the above address. It's a little Guest House 2½ to 3 hours by bus from Dublin. It's not too bad & I hope I'll acclimatise. I'm the only guest. Of course, right now I still feel completely strange & uncomfortable. It's been pretty cold the last fortnight & looking for a place was very depressing. That I haven't worked a stroke for ages goes without saying. I'm looking forward to receiving the det. mags & the book. I, too, have sent you a very small present I don't mean that yours is small. I hope you'll get it. ‒ The idea of staying with you & Lee some day appeals to me very much. I have plenty of money, though. If I were as rich in other respects I'd be very happy!
It was very kind of Lee to write to me on the X-mas card. Give her & Ray all my best wishes. I wish you lots of luck & I know you wish me the same. Both of us need it like Hell.*
Affectionately
Ludwig
*And other people do too.
