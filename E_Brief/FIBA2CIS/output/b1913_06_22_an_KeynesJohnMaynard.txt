Dear Keynes,
You will perhaps remember that I once told you I wished to give some money to the research fund ‒ or whatever you call it ‒ of King's Coll, in order to let Johnson have it. I was then not decided as to whether I would give a capital sum once for all, or two hundred pounds every year. The latter way has turned out to be by far the most convenient to me. Now I do not know when & to whom to send the money etc. etc. & as you are the only person who knows about the matter & I do not wish to tell any one else of my acquaintances I cannot help asking your advice about it. You would oblige me very much if you kindly wrote to me about it, unless there is time for your advice till October, when of course I shall be up at Cambridge. My address till the middle of August will be: L. W. jun
IV. Alleegasse 16
Austria Wien
Yours truly
Ludwig Wittgenstein
