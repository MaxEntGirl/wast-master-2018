Dear Roland,
You write about Monday Aug 5th: but Monday is: Aug 3rd. Never the less I suppose you mean Monday (Bank Holiday). I'll be free on Monday from midday on (as it's Bank Holiday), & I think, it would be better for us ‒ would give us a better chance ‒ if you came about noon instead of late in the afternoon. It, is on the whole, not a good plan for people like us to see each other hurriedly. If its possible we should be together leisurely. Please write me at once whether this suits you. (I'm probably not free on Sunday.)
So long! Good wishes!
Ludwig
