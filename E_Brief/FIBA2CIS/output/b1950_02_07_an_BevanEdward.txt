Dear Doctor,
Thanks a lot for your letter & for the amytal. I had a rather nasty cold lately, accompanied by stomach trouble; I’m afraid I was on the verge of seeing a doctor & very worried about that, but it cleared up by itself & I’m almost as good as new again. I am, of course, slightly liable to get infections these days, what with my blood not entirely up to scratch & the chageable wintery weather. We had -15°C the other day, today it’s thonyling. But this isn’t a complaint. I’m very happy & being treated very well. That’s all the news I know, except that Miss Anscombe is staying with very nice people & learning German rapidly.
Thanks for writing to me about Ben Richards. He wrote to me how very kind you’d been. (As always!) He isn’t so much afraid as very shy & very repressed, particularly before he knows someone well. – I wish I knew how important it really is that he should get a job at Barts . He seems to regard it as important. But I wish he could get out of London! I have an idea Barts isn’t good for him. I don’t mean by this that he is in any danger of becoming superficial, or snobbish, or anything like that. There is no danger there. But I wish he could be with more simple & more kindly people with whom he could open up, or he will get more & more withdrawn.
Forgive me for blithering such a lot.
I’m looking forward to seeing you again. Thanks for everything!
Yours sincerely
Ludwig Wittgenstein
