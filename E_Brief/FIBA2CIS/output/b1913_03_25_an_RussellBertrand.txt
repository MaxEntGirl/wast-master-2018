Dear Russell,
I can't refrain from writing to you, allthough I have nothing to tell you. I am as perfectly sterile as I never was, & I doubt whether I shall ever again get ideas. When ever I try to think about Logic, my thoughts are so vague that nothing ever can crystalize out. What I feel is the curse of all those who have only half a talent; it is like a man who leads you along a dark coridor with a light & just when you are in the middle of it the light gos out & you are left alone. â€’
I supose you are staying with the Whiteheads at present & hope you are having a good time. If once you have nothing better to do, doo send me a line letting me know how you are etc. etc..
L. Wittgenstein
