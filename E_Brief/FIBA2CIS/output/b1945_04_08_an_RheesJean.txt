Dear Mrs Rhees,
Thank you for your letter. I'm sorry, too, that we couldn't see each other. I hope to see you some time in London. It's nice to be here again. The weather is finish but rather cold. ‒ I'm depressing company these days. It's, at least partly, the war, which seems to me to be getting more & more horrid as it draws to its end. And I wonder even if the end is quite as close as those seem to think who already book seats for the V-day procession. The cinema news reels are getting more beastly & gloating every week. The Germans are lucky, because their re-educators are already appointed; but who'll re-educate the English? ‒ I seem to vaguely remember a fairy tale about God cursing the ear of something but it isn't in my edition of Grimm's K & H märchen which is supposed to be complete, & perhaps I don't know it at all. The fair went yesterday but not before I had visited it & lost some money roling pennies & shooting. So long!
Good luck!
Yours sincerely
Ludwig Wittgenstein
