Dear v. Wright,
This is only to thank you for your letter. I'm glad you liked Smythies. I didn't doubt, you would. I feel extremely run down & tired myself &, therefore, shan't write any more today. I hope to see you after the middle of June. Take good care of my typescript â€’ whatever you think of it. I have two more copies of it, but in your copy there are some corrections & additions which don't appear in the other copies.
I very much hope you'll have a good, if short, rest.
Yours
L Wittgenstein
