Dear v. Wright,
Thanks a lot for your letter. The X-ray & the test-meal have shown that there is nothing wrong with my alimentary canal. The doctor sais that my anaemia is a-typical & something between an ordinary & a pernicious anaemia. He thinks that, if I respond well to the iron & liver which I'm getting, I should feel an improvement in a fortnight & that, if I then feel up to it, I might go to Cambridge. In about 2 months he thinks I might be all right again, if everything goes well. ‒ It's very kind of you to say that you'll let me have two rooms, but one room is ample. There is one thing that I'm afraid of: I may not be able to discuss philosophy. Of course it's possible that things will have changed by then, but at present I'm quite incapable of even thinking of philosophical problems. My head is completely dull. ‒ I hope that you will soon get some rest, once the Term is over & I'm looking forward to seeing you even if I feel that I may be a bad companion.
Please give my good wishes to Miss Anscombe & to Smythies via Anscombe. I want to write to them soon.
So long!
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
