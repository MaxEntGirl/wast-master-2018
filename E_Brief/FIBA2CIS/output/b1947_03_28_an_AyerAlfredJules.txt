Dear Professor Ayer,
Thank you for your letter of March 25th. I was glad to read that you had no intention to travesty my work, & if this is so, I know you will in future not even seem to have this intention. The sincere wish to be fair to a man & not to do him an injustice, even if the writer were clumsy - which I have not reason to believe you are - cannot easily be misread; unless the reader is blind, which I hope Iâ€™m not.
Yours sincerely 
L. Wittgenstein
