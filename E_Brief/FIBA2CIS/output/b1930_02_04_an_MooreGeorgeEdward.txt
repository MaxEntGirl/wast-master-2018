sourceDesc:  Original bei Timothy Moore; Kopie im BA. Publiziert (deutsch: Briefe, S. 167; Cambridge Letters, S. 240). 

Text: 
Dear Moore,
I wanted to come & see you to day, partly to ask your advise in a few things concerning College etc. But I have got a bad cold & think I ought to stay at home. Could you come & have tea with me tomorrow (Wednesday) or if that isn't possible the day after? I hope you aren't ill too. If you can come either day don't bother to reply.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
