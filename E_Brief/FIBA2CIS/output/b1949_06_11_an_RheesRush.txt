Dear Rhees,
Thanks for the coffee! I'll have enough now for ages to come. You didn't enclose any sort of bill. Please let me know what I owe you. And don't say "Och!" ‒ I think I'm getting better, though very slowly. I'll have an other blood test done next week & I'm sure it'll show a change. If I were only physically week it wouldn't matter much, but the trouble is I can't think. And I can't (or is it don't) really make an effort. ‒ I intend to leave here on Saturday 18th & fly to London for a few days, then to Cambridge for 10 or 12 days & then to Uxbridge (Richards) until July 21st when I sail on the Queen Mary. Whether I'll be able to dictate at Cambridge & whether I'll be able to stand the life at Uxbridge I don't know. ‒ Swansea has the great disadvantage of being so very hilly. It's beautiful, but I can't climb hills these days. Perhaps, however, this will change soon. I wish I knew. ‒ I should very much like to know if Mrs Rhees could put me up for a few days in July if it were necessary. Perhaps you could find out for me. I intend to go to Cambridge on the 20th, or 21st June & I'll stay with von Wright. His address is: "Strathaird"
Lady Margarets Road
Cambridge. P.T.O.

I very much hope that somehow I'll be able to see you soon! i.e., before going to America, if I do go. ‒
So long! & thanks again!
Ludwig Wittgenstein
Drury sends his good wishes. I see a good deal of him these days.
