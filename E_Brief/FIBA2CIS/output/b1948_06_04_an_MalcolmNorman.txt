Dear Norman,
Thanks a lot for the detective mags. I had, before they arrived, been reading a detective story by Dorothy Sayers, & it was so bl... foul that it depressed me. Then when I opened one of your mags it was like getting out of a stuffy room into the fresh air. And, talking of detective fiction, I'd like you to make an enquiry for me when once you've got nothing better to do. A couple of years ago I read with great pleasure a detective story called "Rendezvous with fear" by a man Norbert Davis. I enjoyed it so much that I gave it not only to Smythies but also to Moore to read & both shared my high opinion of it. For, though, as you know, I've read hundreds of stories that amused me & that I liked reading, I think I've only read two perhaps that I'd call good stuff, & Davis's is one of them. Some weeks ago I found it again by a queer coincidence in a Village in Ireland, it has appeared in an edition called "Cherry Tree books", something like "Penguin". ‒ Now I'd like you to ask at a bookshop if Norbert Davis has written other books, & what kind. (He's an American) It may sound crazy, ‒ but when I recently re-read the story I liked it again so much that I thought I'd really like to write to the author & thank him. If this is nuts don't be surprised, for so am I. ‒ I shouldn't be surprised if he had written quite a lot & only this one story were really good. ‒
My work's so-so; not too good, not too bad. I don't think I'd be much good at philosophical discussion now; but this may mend & then I hope I'll have talks with you! ‒ May you be lucky in every way! Give my good wishes to L.& R..
Affectionately
Ludwig
