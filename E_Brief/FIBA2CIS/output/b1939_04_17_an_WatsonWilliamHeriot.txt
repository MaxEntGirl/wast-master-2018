Text: 
My dear Watson,
Thanks for your letter, dated March 19th. I was very glad to hear from you. I haven’t published, and God knows if I ever shall. Under the present circs. it’s exceedingly difficult for me to work. My sisters are still in Vienna, I can’t go there at present and can do nothing to help them. I may in about a month or two try to get to Vienna, if I find that I’ve got a fairly good chance not to be put into a concentr[ation] camp. I don’t think there’s much chance of my coming to America. I wish you could come here! I’d love to have talks with you.
Ever yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
