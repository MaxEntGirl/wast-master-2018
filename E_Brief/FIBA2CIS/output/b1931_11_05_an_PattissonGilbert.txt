Dear old Beast (if I may be allowed etc.),
You may remember that I gave you some photos a month ago & you promised to send me copies of them. As they haven't yet arrived I assume that you've forgotten the whole thing which would not be quite unlike you. Please do something about it. â€’ I've been to the cinema several times & besides a good deal of muck I have seen an excellent film the name of which I cann't remember (or rather, I never knew it). It was a war film with Buster Keaten & realy as good as Gold, if I may say so.
Wish you'ld soon come to Cambridge. Let me know when you're coming.
Most bl. yours
Ludwig
You may through my generosity one of these days get a free sample of Glostora the famous hairoil, may your hair always retain that gloss which is so characteristic for well groomed gentlemen.
