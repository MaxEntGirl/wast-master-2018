Dear Wittgenstein
Your MS. has been posted to the address you gave in your last letter ‒ it was posted only two days ago, as there were a number of difficulties at the Post Office. I am looking forward to seeing you more than I can say. It is of course possible that I may be refused a passport ‒ if so I will let you know at once.
The furniture-dealers you mention must be B. Jolley & Son, Bridge Str., Camb. I have written to them saying I have your authority to have your things sold, but I think you should write to them also, otherwise they may refuse to accept my authority. If the sale is not yet completed when I come to Holland, I can give you in advance whatever the furniture, books etc. are judged to be worth. They ought easily to pay your expenses.
In all friendship & affection,
your
B. Russell ‒
