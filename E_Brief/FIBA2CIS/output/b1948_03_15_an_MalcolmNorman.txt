Dear Norman,
Thanks for your letter which I got a few weeks ago. v. Wright wrote to me about his putting in for the professorship & asked me to write him a recommendation. I did, & it won't be the recommendation's fault if he doesn't get the job. I don't know at all what his chances are. I'm slightly doubtful because of his being another foreigner. ‒ My work is progressing very slowly & painfully, but it is progressing. I wish I had more working power & didn't tire so very easily. But I have to take it as I find it. ‒ Your mags are wonderful. How people can read Mind if they could read Street & Smith beats me. If philosophy has anything to do with wisdom there's certainly not a grain of that in Mind, & quite often a grain in the detective stories.
That'll be all for today because my brain feels very stuffy indeed.
Good wishes!
Affectionately
Ludwig
