Dear Rhees,
Thanks for your letter. My trip to Norway is off. Richards, with whom I was going to go, failed his exams in June & July & decided to try again at the end of September. We may go in October. Anyway, I'd be very glad to see you & I'm practically always free, except the weekend of this week & the one a fortnight later. Also the first week of September is booked up. Please let me know soonish when you could come. If Miss Anscombe isn't here then you could stay in this house; if she is the Smythies can put you up, or, if you prefer it, I can take a room in a hotel for you. You know of course that you're extremely welcome in this house, or in the Smythies's. You may possibly find it more quiet & comfortable in a decent hotel.
I hope to see you soon. As always
Ludwig Wittgenstein
