My dear Watson,
A friend of mine, Mr. John Wisdom, who is a lecturer in philosophy at Cambridge intends to send his 6 year old boy, and possibly his wife, to Canada, for reasons which you can imagine. I should be greatly obliged to you if, in case they come to Montreal, you would assist them in whatever way you can.
I find this time very trying and exceedingly hard to work in; but I intend trying to think about my subject as long as I have the physical possibility to do so. My health is moderate.
I’m glad that Wisdom’s trouble compelled me to write to you. I like remembering you, and I hope you’re getting on moderately well.
Good luck!
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
