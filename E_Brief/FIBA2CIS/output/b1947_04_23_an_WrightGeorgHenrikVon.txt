Trin. Coll. Wednesday
Dear Prof. v. Wright,
I had your letter this morning. If only you had mentioned that you wished to see me yesterday at the gate!! â€’ I'll be at home today from 1 to 3 p.m. & also after 6 p.m.. So, if you like to see me then, please come to my room (Whewell's Ct. K10). I could also see you tomorrow morning after 11 a.m.. If you'ld like to see me either this evening, or tomorrow morning, please send me a note to that effect; address it to me, don't stamp it, & give it to the porter at the main lodge; he'll send it up to me. If you want to see me today between 1 & 3 don't trouble to let me know; I'll be in my room anyhow.
So long!
Ludwig Wittgenstein
