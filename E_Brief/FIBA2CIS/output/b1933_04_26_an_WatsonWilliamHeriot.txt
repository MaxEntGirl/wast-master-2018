My dear Watson,
Thanks for your letter. It reached me in Vienna where I was busy dictating about 800 pages of my bl. philosophy. They contain all I want to say but very badly said and I have now begun to rewrite the whole business. When that'll be done I'll have it printed (provided that I'm alive). My lectures go on as usual, badly arranged and unintelligible to most of my pupils and there are very few pupils this term. There's nobody you know amongst them except Moore. I saw Drury just before the Easter vac. He is working very hard and at a thankless job. Townsend is teaching in a school and apparently getting on well. From Lee I haven't heard since about 4 months.
