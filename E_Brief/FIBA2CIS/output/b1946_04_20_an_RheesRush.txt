Dear Rhees,
Thanks for your letter of April 16th. What you write didn't seem to me bosh. I could translate it all into my own language (. I don't mean German). I feel very desperate these days & I don't know how to escape from despair. I'm always thinking, as I have so often done in the past, of resigning my job, but I don't know whether that would help matters at all. ‒ Among the books which Morgan has on his shelf but doesn't read there are Bacon's philosophical works. I've been reading in them, mostly in the Novum Organum. I don't find it as interesting, or useful, as I thought I would. Quotations had led me to think that I'ld find it rather thrilling.
So long! Give my good wishes to Mrs Rhees.
Good luck!
Ludwig Wittgenstein
May fate be merciful!
