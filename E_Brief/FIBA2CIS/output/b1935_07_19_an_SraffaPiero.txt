Text: 
Dear Sraffa, 
I should like to change the day of our meeting to Saturday. – I believe I have found the solution of the problem we talked about. It is this: that nothing that I say really interests you. This can only be seen to be the solution, if you think a good deal about it. You like to discuss with me because I am persistent & clever (in a sense), but the other thing which is necessary to make a good discussion that each should enjoy what the other says is lacking (i.e. you don’t enjoy what I say, not vice versa.) 
The enjoyment is in a sense the oil which lubricates discussion & to me perhaps it is the really valuable thing in a discussion. It may at first sound extraordinary that this lack should make such an enormous difference but think what happens to a mashine if it isn’t oiled. If all this conveys nothing to you, don’t be surprised it is again me who is talking to you. 
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
