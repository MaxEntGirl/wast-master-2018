Dear Moore,
I could not leave Cambridge last week as I wished. Instead I had to go to bed on Wednesday with a 'flue. I'm out of bed again but still very weak. Do you think you could come & have tea with me here tomorrow? â€’ But on second thought I find that I shall be absolutely well enough to come to you. So I'll come to you at about 5 p.m., unless I hear from you to the contrary. I very much want to speak to you.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
