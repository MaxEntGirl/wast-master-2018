Dear Malcolm,
Thanks for your letter, dated Sept 9th. I was glad to hea[r] from you. It'll be fine to get detective mags from [you]. There is a terrible scarcity [of] them now. My mind feels [all] underfed. ‒ As a matter of fact I've been feeling pretty rotten most of this summer. Partly because of bad health, partly because my brain was no d... good at all & I cou[l]dn't work. I'm feeling a bi[t] better now: that's to say, my hea[lth] is entirely all right & my mind seems a little more active. But God knows how long that'll last. I wish you good luck; in particular with your work at the university. The temptat[ion] for you to cheat yourself will be overwhelming (tho[ugh] I don't mean more for you than for anyone else in your position.). Only by a miracle will you be able to do decent work in teaching philosophy. Please remember these words, even if you forget everything I've ever said to you; &, [if] you can help it, don't think [t]hat I'm a crank because nobody else will say this to you. ‒ I haven't heard from Smythies for about 4 months. I don't know why he doesn't write nor where he is, or anything. I see very few people these [d]ays. Skinner is almost the [o]nly person I see regularly. He has to work long hours but he's in good health. I don't see Wisdom at all. I've heard from a friend of mine in Montreal about Mrs. Wisdom. I think she's all right. ‒ Good luck!
Affectionately
Ludwig Wittgenstein
