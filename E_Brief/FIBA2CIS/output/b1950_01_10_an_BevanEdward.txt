Dear Doctor,
Thank you very much for the Vit. B., etc. I'm all tanked up with vitamines now & feeling pretty good. â€’ If I could I'd make a provision in my Will that you should be kept in sugared figs for the rest of your natural life.
Give my good wishes to everybody.
Yours sincerely
Ludwig Wittgenstein
P.S. I hope that Ben Richards will make use of the opportunity
