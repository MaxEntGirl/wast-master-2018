Dear v. Wright,
Thank you so much for your letter, dated Aug. 27th. I was very glad to get it. I wish I were in that landscape of yours. It must be similar to the landscape in Norway, which I love. I wish you were here & could help me with my discussion classes. They should start in about 3 weeks; but I can't imagine how I shall be able to lecture. I feel as though, under the present shameful & depressing circumstances, I ought to do anything but discuss philosophical problems, with people who aren't really deeply interested in them anyway.
I should very much like to send you the M.S. of what would be the first volume of my book. I have an idea that it shall never be published in my lifetime & might perhaps be entirely lost. I should like to know that you had read it & had a copy of it. Write me if you like to have it; & if it can be sent I'll send it to you.
I think it goes without saying that I shall always be exceedingly glad to hear from you. I myself am a bad correspondent, especially now that everything that I do seems to me futile & I don't know what sort of life I ought to lead.
Let me hear from you before long.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
