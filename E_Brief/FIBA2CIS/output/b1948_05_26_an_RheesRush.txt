Dear Rhees,
Thanks for your letter & the cutting. What an institution that Church of England is!! ‒ Yes, the weather has been marvellous the last fortnight or so, but though the sun's shining it's pretty cold. ‒ I, too, am glad that v. Wright was elected. ‒ I'm moderately well though I get tired (especially mentally) all too easily. Doing my housework keeps me sane. Drury, whome I saw in Dublin recently, sends his very best wishes.
I hope to see you sometime in the summer.
As always
Ludwig Wittgenstein
