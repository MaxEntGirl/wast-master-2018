My dear Malcolm,
Thanks for the magazines. They're grand but, of course, not as grand as 'Detective Story' mags. I wonder why you tried to be original instead of sticking to the good, old, tried out stuff. â€’ My lectures didn't go too bad this term, & last week I had an 'at-home' & I'm intending to have at-homes regularly now because I have an idea it might steady people a bit if they go on with some sort of decent thinking in spite of the unrest they feel. Of course if people should cease to come that'll be just that. Smythies is still in Cambridge, &, for my own sake, I'm glad he is. Moore isn't looking too well these days. I saw him this morning & he was as nice as ever.
Good luck!!
Affectionately
Ludwig Wittgenstein
