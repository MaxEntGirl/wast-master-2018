Text: 
Dear Russell,
I believe that our problems can be traced down to the atomic props. This you will see if you try to explain precisely in what way the Copula in such a prop has meaning. I cannot explain it & I think that as soon as an exact answer to this question is given the problems of "âˆ¨" & of the app. var. will be brought very near their solution if not solved. I therefor now think about "Socrates is human". (Good old Socrates!). My Iceland-boat leaves Leith on the 7th & I am going to be in Cambridge & London from the 3rd to the 6th. I wonder if I can see you anywhere in that time? I have just read "Chadschi-Murat" by Tolstoy! Have you ever read it? If not, you ought to for it is wonderfull. I am awfully sorry you have such beastly weather in England! Come with me to Iceland!
Yours most etc. etc.
L. Wittgenstein
