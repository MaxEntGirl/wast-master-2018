Dear Russell,
There is the Check for 42 kroner. Thanks very much for having bought the tickets. You haven't yet sent me Miss Harwood's bill! ‒ The following is a list of the questions which you asked me in your letter of the 25.th10.:
1) "What is the point of 'p.°.›p‹ is true'? I mean why is it worth saying"
2) "if 'a p b' is the symbol for p, is 'b p a' the symbol for ~p? & if not, what is?
3) "What you call ab-functions are what the Principia calls 'truth-fns' I don't see why you shouldn't stick to the name 'truth fns'."
4) "I don't understand your rules about a's & b's, i.e. 'the correlation of new poles is to be transitive"
5) (Is obvious from my letter) So is 6)
7) "You say 'weder der Sinn noch die Bedeutung eines Satzes ist ein Ding. Jene Worte sind unvollständige Zeichen' I understand neither being a thing, but I thought the Bedeutung was the fact, which is surely not indicated by an incomplete symbol?"
I don't know whether I have answered the question (7) clearly The answer is of course this: The Bedeutung of a prop is symbolized by the prop ‒ which is of course not an incomplete symbol, but the word "Bedeutung" is an incomplete Symbol.
8) & 9) are obvious.
write soon!
Yours
LW
