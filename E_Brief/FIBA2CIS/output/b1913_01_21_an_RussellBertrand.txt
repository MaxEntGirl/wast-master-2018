IV. ALLEEGASSE 16.
Dear Russell,
my dear father died yesterday in the afternoon. He had the most beautifull death that I can imagine; without the slightest pains and falling asleep like a child! I did not feel sad for a single moment during all the last hours, but most joifull & I think that this death was worth a whole life. I will leave Vienna on Saturday the 25th & will be in Cambridge either on Sunday night or Monday morning. I long very much to see you again.
Yours ever
Ludwig Wittgenstein
