Dear Malcolm,
I was glad to get your letter, dated Oct. 30. I enclose a foul copy of a very wonderful German novel. I couldn't get a decent copy ‒ at least I had no time to look for a better one. German books, as you can imagine, are very difficult to get these days. You may find it rather difficult to read, &, of course, you mayn't like it; but I hope you will. It's a sort of a Christmas present & I hope you won't mind it being so dirty. The advantage of this is that you can read it down in the engine-room without making it more dirty. If you find you like it I'll try to get you the book of which this is only one story. There are five of them called: "Züricher Novellen", because they're all in some way connected with Zürich: Keller was a Swiss, & one of the greatest German prose writers. ‒ As I told you in my last letter I haven't heard from Smythies for ages & have an idea that he has stopped being interested in me. But perhaps it isn't so. ‒ Wisdom is still in Cambridge. I never see him. ‒ Let me hear from you again. Bless you!! Affectionately
Ludwig Wittgenstein
