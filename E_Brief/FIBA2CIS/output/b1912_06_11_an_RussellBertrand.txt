Dear Mr Russell,
I feel very much tempted to write to you although I have very little to say. I have just been reading a part of Moore's Principia Ethica: (now please don't be shocked) I don't like it at all. (Mind you, quite apart from disagreeing with most of it.) I don't believe ‒ or rather I am sure ‒ that it cannot dream of comparing with Frege's or your own works (except perhaps some of the Phil Essays). Moore repeats himself dozens of times, what he says in 3 pages could ‒ I believe ‒ easily be expressed in half a page. Unclear statements don't get a bit clearer by being repeated!! ‒ The concert of the 7th of June was most gorgeous! I wish you had heard it. I need not say that I miss you awfully and that I wish I knew how you are and that I am
Yours most, etc.
Ludwig Wittgenstein
P.S. My logic is all in the melting-pot.
