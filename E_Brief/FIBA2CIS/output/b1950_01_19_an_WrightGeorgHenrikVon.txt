Dear v. Wright,
Thanks for your letter & Hijab's Christmas card. I'm glad you had a good Christmas. Thank you for sending the book to Rhees. I'm sorry you had no time to read it. It's very remarkable. â€’ Things are going very well with me. I'm much stronger & my nerves are all right. I have very good nights without using much of my sedatives. Please let Dr Bevan know about me & give him my thanks for his last (very kind) note. I am completely acclimatized & don't feel the cold as I did at first when I arrived.
I haven't been to a concert so far but I hear a fair amount of music. A friend of mine often plays the piano to me (very beautifully) & one of my sisters & he play piano duets. The other day they played two string quartets by Schumann & a sonata written for 4 hands by Mozart.
The last two weeks I read a great deal in Goethe's "Farbenlehre". It's partly boring & repelling, but in some ways also very instructive & philosophically interesting. You might take it out of your book case & look at what he wrote about Lord Bacon in the historical part.
Give my good wishes to everybody, particularly to your wife.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
