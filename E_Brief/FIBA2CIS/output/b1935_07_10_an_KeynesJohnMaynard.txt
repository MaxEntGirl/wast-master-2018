Dear Keynes,
This is only to thank you for your introduction & to tell you that my interview with Maisky went off all right. He was definitely nice & in the end promised to send me some addresses of people in Russia of whom I might get useful information. He did not seem to think that it was utterly hopeless for me to try to get permission to settle in Russia though he too didn't think it was likely.
Yours ever
Ludwig
