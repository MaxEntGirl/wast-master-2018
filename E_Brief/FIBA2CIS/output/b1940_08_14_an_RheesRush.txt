Dear Rhees,
I was glad to hear from you & that you had given my name as a reference. Of course it's no bother to me! ‒ I'm very sorry, however, that you are thinking of giving up your present job! You may not do it exceedingly well, you may, at times do it badly, you may at times feel very depressed about it, but this will be the case whatever you do. I know it's none of my business & you haven't asked my advice, but I can't help saying: please stick to your present job if it is at all possible. It's an honest job anyway & it has 1000 advantages compared with teaching in a school, advantages which with very little imagination you can tell yourself.
No job will ever absolutly & entirely fit you (just as ready made clothes don't ever fit certain people). What I mean is: please beware of drifting between jobs but thank the Lord that you've found one which however moderately, fits you somewhat.
Forgive me for writing to you in this way.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
