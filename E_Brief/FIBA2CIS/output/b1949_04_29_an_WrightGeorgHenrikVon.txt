Dear v. Wright,
Thanks for your letter. It was forwarded to Vienna. This is only to say that I'm unable at present to write a proper letter. I am here because my eldest sister is ill. I intend to fly to England in 2 or 3 weeks. I'm very much looking forward to seeing you before long.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
