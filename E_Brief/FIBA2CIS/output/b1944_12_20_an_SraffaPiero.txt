Dear Sraffa,
I should like to make remarks about last night’s conversation.
I. About myself.
1) I’m vain & it’s hard for me to admit that I’m wrong, or that an argument has dislodged me.
2) I’m very unclear about things, & find it very difficult to make useful remarks.
3) I think it must be said in my favour that I long for a better & deeper discussion; & when I fall I try, as hard as I know how, to get up & walk again.
II. About yourself.
1) You’re superior to me by being much less vain.
2) You are less clumsy than I am & don’t stumble as easily.
3) You seem to me less anxious to find out whether you are right or wrong than to stay where you are. And you can do this because it is so easy for you to beat off an attacker. In this way your cleverness is a danger to you & I’m inclined to think a grave danger. I believe the only remedy in such a case is this. You must help the other man attack you if he doesn’t do it properly (provided there is anything in him at all). You must help him up if he stumbles, not try to make him stumble. Not out of kindness towards him, but so as to give yourself a chance to see if perhaps after all there’s something wrong in your ideas.
With sincere good wishes, always 
yours 
Ludwig Wittgenstein
