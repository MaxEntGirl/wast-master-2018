Dear Roland,
Sorry I missed you the other day. It's always a good plan to send a wire before you come to avoid disappointment on both sides. I could easily have been in if I'd known. I'm glad you're getting 3 rooms in Farnborough soon. If you're all ready I'll come for a house-warming.
May you live as happily as it is possible in these very awful times.
As always,
Ludwig
