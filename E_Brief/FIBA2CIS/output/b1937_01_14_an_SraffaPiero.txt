Dear Sraffa, 
I’m writing this not knowing whether you’re already up or not. I’ve been in bed with flue & am still too weak to go out. I very much want to see you. 
Could you come to me (above address) tomorrow afternoon at 4 o.c.? I can only stay here for a few more days.
Yours 
Ludwig Wittgenstein
