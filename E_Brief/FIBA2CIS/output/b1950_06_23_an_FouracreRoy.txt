Dear Roy,
Thanks for your letter which I got ages ago. I thought ever so often of writing to you, & after all that's the next best thing to writing! ‒ I'm well & getting more & more stupid every day. I think there must be a leak somewhere in my head & my brain is slowly running out. Even now when I bump my head on anything it sounds like a kettledrum. That's all the news there is. I hope to come to London within the next 2 weeks & then I'll collect you at Guy's & we'll have a meal at Messrs Lyons.
So long! ‒
G. bl. y.
Ludwig
Remember me to Miss Wilkinson.
