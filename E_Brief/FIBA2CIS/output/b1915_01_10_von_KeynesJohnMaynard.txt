KINGS COLLEGE,
CAMBRIDGE.
Dear Wittgenstein,
I am astonished to have got a letter from you. Do you think it proves that you existed within a short time of my getting it? I think so. I hope you have been safely taken prisoner by now.
Russell and I have given up philosophy for the present ‒ I to give my services to the Govt. for financial business, he to agitate for peace. But Moore and Johnson go on just as usual.
Russell, by the way, brought out a new book at about the beginning of the War.
Pinsent had not joined the army by the middle of October but I have not heard since.
Your dear friend Békássy is in your army and your very dear friend Bliss is a private in ours.
It must be much pleasanter to be at war than to think about propositions in Norway. But I hope you will stop such self-indulgence soon.
Yours
JM Keynes
