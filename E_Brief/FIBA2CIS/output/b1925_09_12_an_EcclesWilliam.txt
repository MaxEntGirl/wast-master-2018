D.E., I'm trying the old job again as you can gather from this postcard. However I don' t feel so miserabel now, as I have decided to come to you if the worst came to the worst; which it certainly will sooner or later. Please remember me to your wife, give my affectionate greetings to your children and give Hugh a sound thrashing in my name.
Yours ever
L. Wittgenstein
