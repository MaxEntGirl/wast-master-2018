Dear Norman,
Today I had your parcel with the detective mags. Thanks a lot! They're the real thing! As you see I'm in Wales. I got here a few days ago & should like to stay all through September. I enjoy the climate & not being in Cambridge.
Rhees, whom I think you remember, is here & I see a good deal of him. ‒ We've had two VJ days & I think there was much more noise than real joy. ‒ I've been working a good deal this last academic year, I mean for myself & if everything goes well I might publish by Christmas. Not that what I've produced is good, but it is now about as good as I can make it. I think when it'll be finished I ought to come into the open with it. (By the way, this isn't gossip.) ‒ I hope you're quite safe by now & that you'll be plain Mr, or Dr, soon. Also hope to see you before long & to tell you all I think of you. Rhees sends his best wishes. And so do I. Look after yourself, externally & internally. So long!
Thanks again!
Affectionately
Ludwig Wittgenstein
