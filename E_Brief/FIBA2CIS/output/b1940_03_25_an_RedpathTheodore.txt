Text: 
["Shortly after Easter 1940 he sent me another postcard which expressed a similar spirit. He and Francis Skinner had gone down for a week-end at Hastings to have a blow of sea air together. He was always anxious about Francis's health and thought that this would set him up a bit. I don't know where they actually stayed, but he sent me back a black-and-white postcard photograph of two windmills. Above one of the windmills he had written 'Francis's house' and above the other 'my house' and drawn two arrows pointing down to the supposed respective abodes."]
