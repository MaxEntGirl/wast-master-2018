TRINITY COLL. CAMB.
Wednesday
Dear v. Wright,
Thanks for your letter. I was very glad to get it. Could you come to see me tomorrow (Thursday), say, at 3 p.m.? If you can don't bother to reply. If you can't just ring up Trinity Coll. Porters Lodge & leave a message to that effect. I am pretty deadly as I've been a bit ill all last week & feeling altogether very run down, consequently I'll be dull.
So long!
Ludwig Wittgenstein
