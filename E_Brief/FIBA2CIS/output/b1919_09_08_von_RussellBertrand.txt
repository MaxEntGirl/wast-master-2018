Dear Wittgenstein
Thank you for your letter & explanations, which have helped me a great deal. I am re-reading your book, & will return it as soon as I can do so safely, with remarks ‒ I am very very much impressed by it, though whether it is definitive I don't yet feel sure.
This letter is only about meeting. The only plan that I can see is to try to meet at The Hague at Christmas time ‒ it is doubtful whether I can get leave, for, as you may know, I have fallen out with the Government ‒ but I will do all I possibly can to get permission ‒ I can't come sooner as I have lectures to give, & getting permission will take a long time. Please let me know whether you would probably be able to come to Holland at Christmas or soon after ‒ I could manage a week, if the government will let me go.
 I will write later about your book. I hope you are at liberty now & back in Austria ‒ Has the war injured you in any way?
Yours ever
Bertrand Russell.
