Dear Rhees,
This is only to say that I arrived here safely on Sept 12th after an agreable journey. I found my sisters & friends in good health. As you can imagine Vienna isn't a nice sight at present. In spite of everything the people I meet are in astonishingly good spirits. ‒ There's been no rain here for the last 2 months, & somehow one gets the impression that the climate has changed: it's difficult to imagine that there will be a rainy season again. I've never experienced this sort of incredibly dry weather before. (It isn't agreable, apart from the fact that it's extremely bad for the country.)
I've given my eldest sister your regards & she sends her's. My American sister is in Austria but could only get as far as Upper Austria & isn't allowed to come to Vienna! I shall probably leave here on Oct. 4th & be in Cambridge on the 7th. Then we shall see. ‒ Good luck! I hope to see you before too long!
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
If you write to Mrs Rhees please give her my best wishes.
