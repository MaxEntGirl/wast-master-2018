Dear Mr Saunders,
I had a letter from Dr Ewing yesterday informing me that you decline to write to the Home Office in the matter of my permit (for accepting a University post). Would you please let me know if this is so, or if Dr Ewingâ€™s information rests on some misunderstanding.
Yours truly 
L. Wittgenstein
