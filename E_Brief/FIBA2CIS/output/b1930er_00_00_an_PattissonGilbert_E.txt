My dear Gilbert,
I'm writing this from Ostend where I've got to wait an hour for the departure of my train. I write because it worries me that there was something not altogether satisfactory about our parting yesterday. Some sort of ill feeling or something of the sort caused obviously by my last remark: that I had enjoied the afternoon enormously. What was going on inside me when I made this remark you couldn't, of course, know. For it was not simply repeating something trivial to me but I said it on the background of all sorts of fears, etc. I'm too stupid just now to explain myself & I just wish you could believe that I meant what I said seriously.
Yours ever
Ludwig
