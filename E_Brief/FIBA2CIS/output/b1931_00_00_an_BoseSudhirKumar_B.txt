Dear Bose,
These are two tablets of Allonal. You are allowed to take one before going to bed today and if necessary one tomorrow. But you mustn't go on with these things and I'm glad to say you cann't get them here without prescription. I'm hoping to get good news about your examination.
Yours ever
L. Wittgenstein
