18.6.30.
Dear Moore,
Thanks so much for the good news. I'm very grateful to the Council for its munificence.
I'm glad to hear you are enjoying your holydays. I don't yet enjoy mine, for I haven't yet been able to do any proper work, partly, I believe, due to the opressive heat we've had here during the last week or so, & partly because my brain simply won't work. I hope to God this state won't last long. It is very depressing when all the lights are put out as if there had never been any burning. However, I dare say it'll pass over. ‒ Would you be so very kind & take the Midsummer £50 for me & send them on to my Address? If it's not to[o] much trouble for you I should be very much obliged if you would.
I hope your vacation will continue satisfactorily & that mine will soon be allright too. I'ld be very glad if you would let me hear from you again some time how you're getting on etc.
Yours ever
Ludwig Wittgenstein
