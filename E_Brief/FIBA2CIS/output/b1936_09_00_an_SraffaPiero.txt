Text: 
Dear Sraffa, I thought you might not mind hearing from me so I write to you. I am glad I have come here. Life here does me good though it's not easy (or rather for that reason). I live alone in a little house outside the village. You can't see it on this p.c.. I have to do all the house work myself & it takes a good deal of time. But that's good too. My work goes fairly well. - When I came here I was ill & couldn't recover for some time, but now I'm perfectly well. I think of you quite often & not with disagreable feelings. I also sometimes think of our last conversation in the Backs about Spain & how wrong I was. My address is: Skjolden i Sogn, in case you care to let me hear from you. I hope you are well & that your work goes well. Give my love to Keynes and also to Watson. Tell the latter not to be too damn lazy & to let me hear from him.
Yours 
Ludwig Wittgenstein
My house lies on the lake which begins here, for this is the fjord
