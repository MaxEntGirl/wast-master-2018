Dear v. Wright,
I'm arriving in London on Thursday (23rd) evening. I'd like to stay in London for about a week & then to go to Cambridge for a week or two. I don't know if you'll be away just then. If not, I wonder whether you can put me up. Perhaps you could write a line to me c/o Mrs Rhees, 104 Goldhurst Terrace, London N. W. 6., that's where I'm staying. I'm very much looking forward to seeing you & Mrs v. Wright again. ‒ By the way, thanks for your letter. The news about Braithwaite's being offered a professorship in 'Christian Religion' is indeed almost unbelievable. But then everything is that happens these days. ‒ Thanks for keeping my parcel for me.
I hope to see you pretty soon anyway. Lots of good wishes!
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
