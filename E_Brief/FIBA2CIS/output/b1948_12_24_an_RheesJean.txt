Text: 
My wish for you
What can I wish you for Christmas?
Here's a wish from my heart!
That joy and happiness and love
May never from you part.
from
Ludwig Wittgenstein
I had to wait until Rhees's arrival before sending you this card as I'd forgotten the London district. This morning Rhees came after a foul journey but as kind as ever & he brought me your very kind present. Thanks a lot!
Good luck, always!
