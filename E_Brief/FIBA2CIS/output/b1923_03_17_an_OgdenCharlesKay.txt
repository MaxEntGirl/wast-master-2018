Text: 
Dear Ogden,
I have just got your P.C. dated March 17. "The meaning of meaning" reached me a few days ago. The "other things" you mention must have got lost, except Keynes's edition of the Manchester Guardian. In the last month I have not been quite well, my nerves being run down badly by much work and excitement. This is the reason why I have not yet been able to read your book thoroughly. I have however read in it and I think I ought to confess to you frankly that I believe you have not quite caught the problems which ‒ for instance ‒ I was at in my book (whether or not I have given the correct solution). ‒ My present address is precisely the one you wrote to:
Puchberg am Schneeberg. Nieder-Österreich.
I should love to hear from Ritchie.
Please excuse my remark about your book. I did not make it because I thought that you were interested in my opinion about it, but mearely for the sake of frankness.
I hope you can read this letter. I'm sure there are more faults in it than words.
Yours sincerely
L. Wittgenstein
