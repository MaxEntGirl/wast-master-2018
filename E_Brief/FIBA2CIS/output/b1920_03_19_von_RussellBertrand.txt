Dear Wittgenstein,
I am sending you at last the Introduction which I promised you three months ago. I am sorry to have been so long about it, but breaking my collar bone made me stupid, I am assuming that you will translate it into German. When I have put in brackets "quote number so-and-so", I have meant that it seemed an appropriate place to insert your actual words in the passages referred to. I did not think it worth while to translate your words into English and have you translate them back into German. If there is anything unsatisfactory to you in my remarks, let me know, and I will try to amend it.
How are you? I should like news of you.
Yours affectionately,
Bertrand Russell.
p.p.
E. McL.
