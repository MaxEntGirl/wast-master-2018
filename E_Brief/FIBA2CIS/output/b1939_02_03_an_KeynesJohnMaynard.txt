My dear Keynes,
When yesterday I began to look through the English translation of my book I saw that it was a good deal worse than I had expected, so correcting it seemed almost hopeless. But I went through it nevertheless, as far as I could get in these two days, & corrected it almost word for word, as you will see when you look at the English M.S.. I couldn't do more than about 20 pages in this way. If you can read a little German I should try to read the German text. The whole thing seems even more of a farce now than it did a few days ago.
Good wishes!
Yours ever
Ludwig
