Dear Miss Ambrose,
Thanks so much for your letter which I got almost 2 months ago. As soon as I got it I sat down to answer it & wrote about half a page. Then I was interrupted, from that moment the planets were adverse & something always kept me from writing. ‒ I needn't say that I was very pleased indeed to hear that you had got your scholarship; though I never doubted that you would get it. ‒ I am looking forward to dining with you & I'm sure the american food will be good; but I must say that I don't mind a bit going to Lyon's every day. In fact I'm fond of the place. ‒ I was glad to hear that you had talked to Belmont. It was the right thing to do & good for all concerned.
I hope to talk about the foundations of Math. next year though I certainly should begin with it. I wonder what our class will be like!
I'm afraid I shan't see you before autumn as I'm not in Vienna in August except for a few days when I shall be very busy.
I hope this letter will reach you before October.
Yours very sincerely
Ludwig Wittgenstein
