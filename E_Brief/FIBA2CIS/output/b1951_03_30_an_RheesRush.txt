Dear Rhees,
Thank you ever so much for sending me the book about Japan. It arrived yesterday & I immediately began to read in it; first the beginning & then a bit in the middle. It interests me very much. I don't know if I always like the way it's written. But of course I can't tell from the little I've read so far. ‒ I don't know if I told you that I had made the acquaintance of a book which I like & admire a lot. It's a book called "Rommel" by one Brigadier Desmond Young. It's a kind of biography of Rommel & describes his exploits in France & Africa. It is extremely interesting, seems to me very well written & with complete fairness & without a trace of meanness. I wonder what you'd think of it. ‒ I am, on the whole, pretty well, rather weak of course, & occasionally having very mild pain. I have no cause to grumble!
I'm looking forward to seeing you.
Thanks again. As always
Ludwig Wittgenstein
