TRINITY COLL. CAMB.
27.8.47.
Dear Norman,
Thanks for your letter which I received about 3 weeks ago. You know how much I enjoyed being with you at Cambridge. And, of course, you owe me nothing. My mind is rather in a turmoil these days. I am almost certain that I shall resign my professorship in Autumn. I have not yet told Rollins, & please keep it to yourself as it's not yet certain. I hate to let down Rollins & Lazerovitz but I think I won't be able to help it. I'ld like to be alone somewhere & try to write & to make at least one part of my book publishable. I'll never be able to do it while I'm teaching at Cambridge. Also I think that, quite apart from writing, I need a longish spell of thinking alone, without having to talk to anybody. But I haven't yet told the autorities about my plan & I don't intend to do so until October when I'll decide definitely.
I wish you all possible good luck & I hope that I shall see you again one day! It was good to be with you! Give my warmest wishes to Lee & say 'good luck' from me to Ray.
Let me hear from you!
Affectionately
Ludwig
P.S. I'm going to Austria on Sept 10th until about Oct. 7th. Trinity will always find me.
