Dear Moore,
Upon clearing up some papers before leaving Skjolden I popped upon your letter which had made me so wilde. And upon reading it over again I found that I had probably no sufficient reason to write to you as I did. (Not that I like your letter a bit now) But at any rate my wrath has cooled down & I'ld rather be friends with you again than otherwise. I consider, I have strained myself enough now for I would not have written this to many people & if you don't answer this I sha'n't write to you again.
Yours etc etc
L.W.
