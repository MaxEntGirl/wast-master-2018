TRINITY COLL. CAMB.
18.2.47.
Dear Moore,
I think I'd better not come & see you this Thursday. I'm in good health, but teaching philosophy almost every day seems to exhaust me a good deal & it might be better if I avoid a serious talk on Thursday. You know, of course, I'd like to come, for I enjoy talking with you, & I don't really know if it's worth saving my strength for teaching people most of whom can't learn anything anyway. If you let me I'll come to you next week or the week after.
Yours ever
Ludwig Wittgenstein
