TRINITY COLL. CAMB.
6.11.47.
Dear v. Wright,
Thanks for your letter. I have resigned but my professorship ends on December 31st. I shall stay here for another 3 weeks, I'm dictating some of the stuff which I wrote during the last 2-3 years. It's mostly bad but I've got to have it in a handy form, i. e. typewritten, because it may possibly give rise to better thoughts when I read it. I don't know where in Ireland I shall be but the address "Trinity College" will always find me. I am in no way optimistic about my future but as soon as I had resigned I felt that it was the only natural thing to have done. ‒ In dictating my stuff I am using up the paper you were so very nice to bequeathe to me. ‒ "Der Schmetterling" I don't like as much as "Eduards Traum", but it's wonderful in parts. Especially the homecoming. You are quite right, I found the book by an extraordinary chance in a shop in Vienna.
I hope to hear from you often if you're not too busy. I wish you luck!
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
