Dear Mrs Rhees,
Please forgive me for not thanking you for your letter. One reason was laziness, but there were other reasons, too. I've had lots of worries lately & wasn't feeling too well. ‒ I don't know whether or not I shall accept your kind offer to stay with you, for my moves in the near future are very uncertain, I'm afraid.
I should very much like to see you again.
Yours very sincerely
Ludwig Wittgenstein
