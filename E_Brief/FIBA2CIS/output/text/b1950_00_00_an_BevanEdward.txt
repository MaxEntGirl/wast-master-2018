Tuesday 
Dear Bevan,
Thanks for your note. I should like to come to Cambridge N next week, either Tuesday or Wednesday, for 2 or 3 days. Can you put me up & can I see you then? I’d very much like to see you before going to Norway in the beginning of August, for medical & non-medical reasons. If you, either, can’t out me up, or can’t see me, please send me a note or a wire to the above address. – Don’t give the children too many Chinese Figs, they aren’t good for them. In China they are manufactured exclusively for the use of doctors.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
