Text: 
Dear old Blood, I'm sure you'll be interested to see me as I walk with a sister & a friend of mine in an exhibition of bloody modern houses. Don't I look enterprising?! You can gather from this picture that we had very hot weather but not that there was a terrific thunderstorm half an hour after this was taken. I am, old God, yours in bloodyness
Ludwig
