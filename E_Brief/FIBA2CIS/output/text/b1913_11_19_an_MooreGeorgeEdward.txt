Dear Moore ‒
Many thanks for your P. C. I am very sorry that you feel so miserable at times about your work. I think, the cause of it is, that you don't regularly discuss your stuff with anybody who is not yet stale & is really interested in the subject. And I believe that at present there is no such person up at Cambridge. Even Russell ‒ who is of course most extraordinarily fresh for his age ‒ is no more pliable enough for this purpose. Don't you think it would be a good thing if we had regular discussions when you come to me at Easter? Not ‒ of course ‒ that I am any good at the subject! But I am not yet stale & care for it very much. I cann't help thinking that this would make you loose your feeling of sterility. I think you ought to think about your problems with the view to discuss them with me at Easter. Now don't you think that I am arrogant in saying this! I don't for a moment believe that I could get as clear about your questions as you can, but ‒ as I saied before ‒ I am not yet waisted & am very interested in the stuff. Do think this over. ‒ Let me hear from you soon.
Yours
most etc
L. Wittgenstein
