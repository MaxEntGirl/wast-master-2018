Dear Wittgenstein,
I do not know of anyone [here] who has made a special study of diabetes though no doubt there are several doctors who would be quite competent to look after a case. As regards a London man, the only one I know is Dr. George Graham, 149 Harley St. W. 
He has specialised in the subject for many years & is a recognized authority – in fact the authority in the country. I should think his advice would be sound, for he must have had a very wide experience of diabetes. He comes up here to examine sometimes & so would be in touch, probably, with the local doctors & could tell them how to carry on. Graham must be a man of about 55 (he was here as a student). There are probably several younger men who specialise in diabetes, but I don’t know of any, & although Graham is sound & careful rather than brilliant & ingenious I should think his advice would be good.
Yours sincerely 
E D Adrian 
[AN PIERO SRAFFA]
Dear Sraffa,
a) Note how intelligently this is written. b) Adrian, as you see, doesn’t recommend any Cambr. doctor for every day use. I therefore wrote to him again asking him whether he could do so or whether Dr. Graham should recommend a g.p. c) I had a letter from my eldest sister (you met in Vienna) yesterday sounding rather optimistic. She asks to give you her best wishes.
L.W.
