Dear Miss Rand,
Thank you for your letter dated April 22nd. You have, in my opinion, no chance whatever of getting money from a university. A ›Fellowship‹ is, of course, out of the question; but so, I believe, is a Studentship, or even a Research Grant.
I should advise you to leave this idea completely out of your plans & to resign yourself to doing work which, though it may not attract you as much as university work, will perhaps be more useful.
Yours sincerely 
L. Wittgenstein
