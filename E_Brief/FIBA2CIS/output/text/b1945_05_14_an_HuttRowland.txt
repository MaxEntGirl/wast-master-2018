My dear Roland,
Thanks for the detective book. I liked it. Yes, I should like to see you before long; say, in July. I could come to Farnborough; but wouldn't that be definitely inconvenient for your mother? In a way I'ld prefer seeing you in Farnborough to seeing you here. Cambridge gets on my nerves! I'm sorry that your work is not satisfactory. Mine isn't, though in a different way.
I should like to see Goodstein again but I never get to Reading, & anyway I'ld like to see him alone.
The last 6 months have been more nauseating than what went before. I wish I could leave this place & this country for a while & be alone somewhere as I was in Norway. I suppose many people would like that!
Perhaps I could stay at some Hotel in Farnborough, so I wouldn't clutter up your house.
Write about this.
So long!
Ludwig
