Dear Sraffa,
I’ve had a book seller send you “The thin man”, a detective story, I told you about a few months ago. Read it & don’t be ashamed of liking it even though you know that I liked it. I’ve seen your mother several times. She looks well & didn’t seem a bit depressed.
Hutt has been called up.
I had quite good news from my sister in New York.
I am & feel just as usual.
Yours 
Ludwig Wittgenstein
