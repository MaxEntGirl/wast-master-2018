Dear von Wright,
Miss Anscombe wrote to me a few weeks ago that you had put in for the professorship. I shall write the recommendation in a few days & send it to the Registrary as you suggest. May your decision be the right one! I have no doubt that you will be a better professor than any of the other candidates for the chair. But Cambridge is a dangerous place. Will you become superficial? smooth? If you don't, you will have to suffer terribly. ‒ The passage in your letter which makes me feel particularly uneasy is the one about your feeling enthusiasm at the thought of teaching in Cambridge. It seems to me: if you go to Cambridge you must go as a sober man. ‒ May my fears have no foundation, & may you not be tempted beyond your powers!
If I wanted to play providence I'd write you a lukewarm recommendation; but I won't. I'll write you as good a one as you can possibly wish for. For what can I know about the future?
Good luck!
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
