Text: 
Dear Keynes,
Thanks so much for your letter. I will come to London on the 16th at 10h 40 in the evening (via Boulogne-Folkstone) Please let me meet you in London as I don't like the idea of traveling about in England alone now. If you will send me some money for the journey I shall be very glad. I'm awfully curious how we are going to get on with one another. I[t] will be exactly like a dream.
Yours ever
Ludwig Wittgenstein
