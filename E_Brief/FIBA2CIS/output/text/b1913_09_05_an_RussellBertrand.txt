Dear Russell,
I am siting here in a little place inside a beautifull fiord & thinking about the beastly theory of types. There are still some very difficult problems (& very fundamental ones too) to be solved & I won't begin to write untill I have got some sort of a solution for them. However I don't think that will in any way affect the Bipolarity-business which still seems to me to be absolutely untangible. Pinsent is an enormous comfort to me here. We have hired a little sailing boat & go about with it on the fiord, or rather Pinsent is doing all the sailing & I sit in the boat & work. Shall I get anything out??! It would be awfull if I did not & all my work would be lost. However I am not loosing courage & go on thinking. Pray for me! If you see the Whiteheads please remember me to them. My address for the next 3 weeks shall be:
Hotel Öistensjö
Öistensjö Norway.
If you've nothing better to do, do write to me how you are etc. I very often now have the indescribable feeling as though my work was all sure to be lost entirely in some way or other. But I still hope that this won't come true. What ever happens don't forget me!
Yours ever most etc
L. W.
