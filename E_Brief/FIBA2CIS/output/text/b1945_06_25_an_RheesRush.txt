Dear Rhees,
Thanks a lot for your letters. I don't mind if Morgan's not there. I can very well manage alone; particularly if his mother will drop in once a week. I shall write Morgan today & thank him. I'm working only very moderately well just now. The fact that reading my own remarks gets on my nerves shows me what a bum worker I really am. This doesn't show clearly while I'm writing. ‒ I read a wonderful book these days: "Hadshi Murat" by Tolstoy. Do you know it? If you don't I'll try to get a copy for you.
So long! & Good luck! I'm looking forward to seeing you. Moore sends his best wishes.
L. Wittgenstein
