Dear Townsend,
I wonder how you are. I don't dare to leave Cambridge now as, if things should start happening while I was away, I might not be able to come back, & I don't want to leave Skinner in any serious trouble â€’ though God knows whether I'll be able to help him in the least. Are you going to be anywhere near here before long? I should like to hear from you soon.
I've been reading a good deal lately in a book called "Prayers & Meditations" by Dr Johnson. I like it very much.
I wish you good luck, outside & inside!
Affectionately yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
