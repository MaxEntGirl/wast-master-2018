Dear Rhees,
I haven't yet thanked you for your letter of Jan. 9th though I often wanted to. I am in very good bodily health. My nerves, I'm afraid, often misbehave. Of course they're tired & old nerves. ‒ My work, on the whole, goes fairly well. Again, it's the work of an old man: for, though I am not really old, I have, somehow, an old soul. May it be granted to me that my body doesn't survive my soul! ‒ I saw Drury about a fortnight ago. He sends you all his good wishes. He is very busy indeed. While I am here, i.e. comparatively close to Dublin, we shall see each other about once a month. ‒ The winter is very mild, I'm glad to say, & not so wet that I can't go for a walk almost every day, which does me lots of good. There is nothing like the Welsh coast line here, but the colours are most wonderful & make up for everything. ‒ If ever you should see one of the Clements' I wish you could find out whether they got a letter from me about Christmas with a cheque for £ 2-0-0 enclosed. They sent me a Christmas card but didn't mention my present, so I'm wondering. I needn't tell you I don't want any thanks, but I'd like to know if they've got it.
You may wonder what this pencil line means. The answer is: it means nothing. I don't know how it's got there. I found it to my surprise when I turned the page. Which just shows you ‒.
I hope you won't have bad news from your mother & I hope we shall be able to see each other before long.
Ludwig Wittgenstein
