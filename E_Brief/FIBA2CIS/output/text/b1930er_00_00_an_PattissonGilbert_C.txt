Dear Gilbert,
Yesterday night I discovered that I had not posted the letter to Lep Transport! So I posted it at 11 p.m. & they will have got it this morning. Anyway we can't expect the parcel till tomorrow morning or afternoon. I'm sorry this happened. â€’
As to our conversation the other day, I think now that you were entirely right when you said that I was one of the most charming men of our time. I then would not admit it, perhaps because of my almost blameworthy modesty, perhaps ---- any way, we can talk this over when I come to London on Friday evening.
Bl. y.
Ludwig
