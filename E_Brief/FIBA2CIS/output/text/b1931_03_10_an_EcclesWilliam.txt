Text: 
10.3.31 Trinity College
Cambridge
My dear E., 
I have been very busy this term & though I've very often thought of writing to you I always put it off. Just before Xmass I was elected to a research fellowship of Trinity College which means: no more financial difficulties for 5 years & that I can devote my time to the work I want to do. As a matter of fact my capacity for the particular kind of work will in all probability have left me in 2 or 3 years & then I shall probably resign my fellowship.
What with lecturing & my own work I'm too busy to get away from Cambridge during termtime, I haven't even been to London once. But we could arrange to meet there some day, whereas it's impossible for me to come to Timperley. And as soon as term's over I rush home to Vienna where several people want to see me (not that they have any very good reason, but they do). I'm going down for the Easter vacation on Friday & coming up again about the 20th of April. Let me know if you ever come to London. Weekends would be not good for me as they are my busiest time, but Wednesdays & Thursdays (particularly the latter) would do.
Let me know about your work etc. I hope your family is well. Please remember me to all of them. ‒ A man I should like very much to hear from is Jim Bamber. I wrote to him about 6 months ago but got no reply. If you happen to see him, please remember me to him & if he has got my letter & not answered it for sheer laziness tell him that I think he is a beast. ‒
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
