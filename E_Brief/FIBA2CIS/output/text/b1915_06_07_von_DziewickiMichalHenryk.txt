Dear Mr Wittgenstein,
I have been expecting you for more than a week; but perhaps you have been specially busy. Remember: any day after 7. P.M. except Mondays and Fridays; on those days I am free at 8.15. I offered you only tea last time you came, for our supper (in this time of war) is so frugal that we are quite ashamed to ask you to partake of it and as you come unexpectedly and the shops are closed at that time, we cannot make any preparations to receive you as a guest. But 'pot luck' is very poor luck with us. Perhaps too, you were disappointed at the turn our conversation took: too desultory. But you must remember that I am only an amateur, a dabbler, interested in lots of points, but not knowing, which is the most important. You will choose for yourself what you consider fundamental, if you wish to come again. ‒ Only I should like to know whether you also hold that the series of instants is compact. Wyclif thought not; for him all instants are contiguous. If not, there is never any instant at which any phenomenon begins: which seems absurd. Shall we say that the last instant of a man's life is the first instant of his death? or that there are infinite instants between the two? or that there is no first, no last instant? If not these instants are contiguous, and this is Wyclif's system for time with similar proofs as concerns contiguous points in space.
