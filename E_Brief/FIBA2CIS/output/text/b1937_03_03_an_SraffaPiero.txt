Dear Sraffa, 
I often think of you & should like to hear from you. Did you read Lichtenberg? I hope you did & enjoyed it.
My work hasn’t been going well after I came back here, but I can’t write about this now. It’s going a little better at present.
If it were possible I should very much like you to see Skinner. He has no one to talk to sensibly & seriously & I can’t help thinking it would do him a lot of good to see you, even if you didn’t have a terrific conversation. I think just seeing you would do him good.
Give my love to Keynes & to Watson. I should like to hear from Watson.
Yours 
Ludwig Wittgenstein
