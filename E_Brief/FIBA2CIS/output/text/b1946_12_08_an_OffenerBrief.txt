Testimonial:
I have known Mr Rowland Hutt intimately for about 14 years. I made his acquaintance when he came to my philosophical classes for a few terms, & since then I have always been in friendly contact with him. He has an excellent intellect & is an exceedingly kind, serious & conscientious man. I feel sure that he will have a genuinely good influence on the character of his pupils.
