Dear Roland,
Thanks for your letter. I intend to stay in Swansea till the end of September, or beginning of October. After that I'll probably take on a war-job again. I don't know yet what or where. My health hasn't been good at all lately, but these seems to be nothing a doctor can do about it. I'm sorry your work is dull, this is a great pity but perhaps it just can't be helped. Drury is in Normandy now. I heard from him yesterday. He is all right, so far. His address (in case you'ld like to write to him) is: 101287 Capt. M.O'C. Drury R.A.M.C., N° 6 British General Hospital B.L.A.
If I come to London in about 2 months & perhaps get work there we may be able to see each other. I haven't heard from Ffennell, or from Goodstein for a long, long time.
Good luck!
So long!
Ludwig
