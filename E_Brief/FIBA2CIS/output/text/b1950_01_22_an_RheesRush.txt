Dear Rhees,
Thanks for your letter. The Busch is second hand & nasty, but I thought I was lucky to find it at all. The letters are rather difficult to understand, I imagine, because he uses quaint & odd expressions (but they are wonderful). He has the real philosophical urge.
I feel very well indeed. My brain is mudled & sluggish but I can't say I mind. I have been reading again parts of Goethes "Farbenlehre" which attracts & repels me. It's certainly philosophically interesting, & I've been thinking about it & even written down some weak remarks. ‒ My sister is rarely more than half awake though occasionally she says astoundingly clear & deep things. ‒ I'm sorry to hear that you feel harrassed. Take it easy! if you possibly can. ‒ I hope to see you soon after coming back to England. If I'm as well then as I'm now I could even come to Swansea & we might talk a little philosophy, though I'm pretty stupid. Please give Mrs Rhees my very kind regards! If it hadn't been for her kindness I don't know where I'd be now.
So long!
As always,
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
