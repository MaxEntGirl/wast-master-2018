Dear Norman,
I flew to Vienna on Dec. 24th, which shows you that I am in fairly good health. I am no longer 'despondent', if I ever was. So far I've been very, very lucky. I'm well taken care of here & the food I get is grand! ‒ Please see to it that my health is not being unnecessarily discussed; it wouldn't help a bit. ‒ I haven't yet got any Christmas present for you or Lee. It'll be an Easter present if any. ‒ I found my eldest sister so weak that I can't imagine that she will live for many more weeks. She is being taken care of extremely well & has everything she needs. ‒ The parcel Lee sent to Dublin has arrived there & will be forwarded to me here. I'm sure it's marvelous & much too good for me. ‒ Give all my best wishes to Lee & Ray, & also to Doney & Prof. Bowsma, & don't forget yourself either.
Affectionately
Ludwig
