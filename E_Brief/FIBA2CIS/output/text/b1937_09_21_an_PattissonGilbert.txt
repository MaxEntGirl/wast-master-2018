Dear Gilbert,
Thanks for the 50 Â£, the 'Pilgrims Progress' & your letter from your palace. I've had trouble again with my gall but not nearly as bad as last year. I'm fairly well again & working a fair amount. I don't think though, I shall stay here very long. I shall probably before very long return to England (Cambridge) or go to Ireland (Dublin). Remember me please to your people.
Always bloodily
Ludwig.
