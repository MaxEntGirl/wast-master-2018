Thursday 
Dear Doctor,
I have the following quantities of medicine in my possession:
    12 tablets stilboestrol + ca 
    25 plastules containing iron, vit B etc. 
    6 tablets phenobarb (½ grain) 
So could you send me prescriptions for some more of these things? Unless you prefer sending me a bottle of some nice poison, that is. As I know you, you’ll take the long and troublesome way. I go on vegetating as before. At that rate I’ll never die! – I hope you’re not overworking like hell & that you & your family are well.
 Thanks for all your kindness, & sorry to bother you.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
P.S. I’m planning to go to Norway about Oct. 10th & may come to Cambridge & ask you look at me, if you will be kind enough, before I go.
