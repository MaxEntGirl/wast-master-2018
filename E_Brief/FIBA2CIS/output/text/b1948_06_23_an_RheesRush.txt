Dear Rhees,
This is only to say: thanks for your letter & for the cutting. Isn't Monty incredible?! If only I could get those marvelous war speeches where he said something like "The thing is very nice, I like it very much", refering to the operations in France, I believe. I wish you good luck for your jour[n]ey!! ‒ I plan to come to England in August &, if poss. to go to Austria in September & to return here afterwards. I'm afraid my travelling will cost lots of money & I might find that a stay in Swansea exceeds my budget, still I hope to see you somehow & somewhere when I'm in England. ‒ My work isn't going well, but it could be still worse, & I'm trying to say to myself that I haven't given myself the ability or the inability & to leave it at that & quench any rising ambition.
Good luck, again!
I'm looking forward to seeing you before long.
Ludwig Wittgenstein
