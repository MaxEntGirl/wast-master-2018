3.2.15.
Dear Eccles,
It's ages since we wrote to one another last, and I think it's very nice of me to start our correspondence again: I dare say you know that I joined our army as a vollunteer at the beginning of the war. I supose you two are working for your country in some way or another. I am pretty well so far & have done a good deal of mathematical work during the last 6 month. ‒ How are you & how is Ada & Mrs Moore etc etc?
I'm sending this letter via The Read Cross Genève Switzerland. Send your answer the same way soon. My address is:
K. u. K. Artillerie Werkstätte
der Festung Krakau
Feldpost N° 186
Please remember me to everybody who likes to be reminded of my existence. So write soon & a lot.
Yours ever
Ludwig Wittgenstein
P.S. I've forgotten your address so am sending this to Dr Moore's place.
