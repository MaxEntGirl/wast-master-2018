Dear Mr Vice-Chancellor,
I have, after considering the matter for a long time, decided to take on some war-work, & I have accepted a job of “dispensary porter” at Guy’s Hospital, London. I ought therefore, to leave Cambridge at the beginning of next week. Would you be so very kind as to grant me an interview some time this week. I should like to apply for leave of absence.
Yours sincerely, 
L. Wittgenstein
