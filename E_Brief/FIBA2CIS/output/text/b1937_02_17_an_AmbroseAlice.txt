Dear Miss Ambrose,
I am ashamed not to have sent you a card at Christmas. You were on my list of people to whome I intended to write but somehow you were forgotten. A few days ago your card arrived here & I was pleased to get it. So take my best wishes for the New Year although a bit of it has already passed. I've been living in Norway since last August, but I've been home & in England round about Christmas. I hope your work is going well & I hope you have forgiven me for inflicting pain upon you while you were in Cambridge.
Yours sincerely
Ludwig Wittgenstein
