Dear v. Wright,
Thanks for the shoes which arrived the day after I did. I enjoyed what talks we had & I liked to see Kreisel again. I hope you still saw him after I left. I hope your journey to Finland won't be too unpleasant & that you'll spend your time there profitably. Let me hear from you if you've nothing better to do. Give all my good wishes to your wife & to Bevan if you see him. I'm pretty well & pretty stupid.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
