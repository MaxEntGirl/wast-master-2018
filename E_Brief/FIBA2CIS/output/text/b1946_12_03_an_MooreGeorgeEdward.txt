Dear Moore,
As far as I can see now I will be in London on Thursday afternoon & unable to see you. Would it be all right if I called on you in case I were here after all? If you're otherwise engaged then, it doesn't matter & I'll just go again. If, as is most likely, I shan't be back on Thursday afternoon, could I see you Thursday week? â€’ Price at the last Mor. Sc. Cl. meeting was by far better than Austin had been. Price was willing to discuss important points. Unfortunately (I believe) Russell was there & most disagreeable. Glib & superficial, though, as always, astonishingly quick. I left at about 10.30 & felt exceedingly happy when I was out in the street & away from the atmosphere of the M. Sc. Cl..
So long!
Yours
L. Wittgenstein
