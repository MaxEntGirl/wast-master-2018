Dear Norman,
I returned from Vienna on March 23rd & came here yesterday. I found Lee's & your lovely Christmas parcel & am enjoying it's contents. ‒ I had a letter from Oxford the other day, inviting me to give 6 lectures on philosophy. There are to be lectures of that sort every year by people outside Oxford. The lectures are called John Locke lectures & I'd get £ 200 for them. I was told, however, that I'd have to expect a large audience, over 200 students, & there mustn't be any discussion during the lectures. I haven't yet given them any definite answer but I think I'll reply in the negative. I don't think I can give formal lectures to a large audience that would be any good. ‒ I feel fairly well, though not quite as good as I did in Vienna, & I'm very dull & stupid. In this state one shouldn't write letters but I wanted to thank Lee & you for the Christmas parcel & to wish you all a happy Easter. Give my love & good wishes to anyone who has any use for them.
Affectionately
Ludwig
I wish you & I & Doney could again have some discussions!
