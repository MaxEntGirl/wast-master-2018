My dear Norman,
Thank you ever so much for the mags I got from you yesterday. It was good to feel that we're still in contact. I feel very perturbed in my mind. I haven't done any decent work for ages apart from my classes. They went all right last term. But now my brain feels burnt out, as though only the four walls were left standing, & some chared remains. Let's hope that I'll be in moderately good condition when you'll be here! I'm looking forward to seeing you. I spent most of the Easter vac in Swansea. I saw Rhees there & had discussiones with him. I came up the day before yesterday. I haven't yet seen Smythies. Tomorrow's my first lecture. Oh hell!!
I wish you a better head & a better heart than I have.
Affectionately
Ludwig
