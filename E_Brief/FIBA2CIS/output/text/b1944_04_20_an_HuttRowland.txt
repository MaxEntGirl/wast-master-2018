Dear Roland,
I had your letter, dated April 15 this morning.
Although it's none of my business I want to say that if I were you I'ld not go to your Commander now about the commission. Do that work decently which you're doing now. Don't always look into the future. They may not put you into the op. theater, & if they do you may not be a success. It seems to me that you're alternately living in unfounded hopes & in despair. Look at the work you're doing. If you're really doing it well they may give you a chance elsewhere. To pester your Commander about a commission now seems to me silly. Nothing has changed since you've been refused! You write: "All these steps have made or will make my position here satisfactory, or at least a lot better." This is all nonsense; & it makes me really sick to read it. The one step which can make things more satisfactory for you is a step that has to be taken inside you. (Though I won't say that getting away from your family mightn't help.)
Good wishes, as always!
Ludwig
