Dear Sraffa,
This is only to tell you a) that I had a note from Keynes saying that his solicitor has advised him to write to some official at the Home Office about my case (which ought obviously to help me a lot); b) that I had a letter from my sister in Vienna saying how very glad they were to have met you & talked with you.
Yours 
Ludwig Wittgenstein
Mark the golden rim of this card, it’s the sort of thing I’m going in for now.
