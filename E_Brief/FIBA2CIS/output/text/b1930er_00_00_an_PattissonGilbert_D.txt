Dear Gilbert,
This is only to tell you how very pleased I was to see your Father this morning. It was very kind of him to climb up all these stairs. Please, if it can be done naturally, tell him that I appreciated his kindness very much indeed. â€’ I hope you have got your crutches. I was glad I ran into you on Bloomsbury square. Let me have a word from you sometime. soonish.
Yours i. bl.
Ludwig
P.S. I read in 'John O'London's': "There are few walks in life in which a sound knowledge of English does not help towards success..... It is the little slips in English which are so damaging. An apparently insignificant mistake may have serious consequences..... Just one fault may cost you your job......"
Yours truly
L.W.
