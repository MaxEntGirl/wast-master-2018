Dear Sraffa,
I enclose the note from my nephew with the quotation from Spengler.
This however isn’t the reason why I’m writing to you, but the reason is that yesterday when I asked you what your address was going to be in the vac (so I could write to you if anything of interest to me happened) you answered in such a way that I got the impression that you’ld almost rather not hear from me. If my impression was correct (or pretty nearly correct) I should like you to confirm it.
As to the quotation from Spengler I wish to say that, although it doesn’t seem to me to matter in the least that you get nothing out of it, it does seem to me important that when I told you the quotation you reacted to it with a smile (of a particular sort). I must confess again that I don’t like this phenomenon at all. It is, of course, the attitude of contempt for what you don’t understand (an attitude you have denounced more than once in our conversations). I believe I know how excellent & sound your understanding is, as far as it goes; but I believe that it is very narrowly bounded, & I can’t help believing that you have no idea of how narrowly bounded it is.
I must say also that this in no way detracts for my respect (etc.) for you. In fact, if I had not as much of these feelings toward you as I have I would not take the matter so seriously. I hope this doesn’t sound as though it were meant as an advice from a wiser man to one less wise. (You know what I think of myself.)
I wish you a good luck, in every way!
Yours 
Ludwig Wittgenstein 
P.S. This morning my solicitor wrote me saying that the Under Secretary of State has notified them that he is now prepared to grant me a Certificate of Naturalization on receipt of £9.
Please keep the note from my nephew, I mean, don’t destroy it.
