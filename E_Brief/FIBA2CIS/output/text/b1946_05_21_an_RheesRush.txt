Dear Rhees,
Thanks for your letter of May 19th, which arrived this morning. I was glad to hear that they had the sense to offer you an appointment again at Swansea. I wish to God you'ld take it!! I don't know, of course, what your special reasons are for wanting to leave Swansea, but please weigh them damn carefully. I should, for personal reasons, hate you to leave Swansea. Our talks & discussions have done me good. Don't stupidly throw away an opportunity of doing some good. Your derogatory remarks about your philosophical abilities & success are so much rubbish. You are all right. And I mean just that: nothing more & nothing less. ‒ Philosophical influences much worse than yours & mine are spreading rapidly, & it's important that you should stay at your job. That your success won't be brilliant is certain; in fact it will be meagre, it's bound to be. Please, if you possibly can, resign yourself to it & stay on. ‒ Don't misunderstand me. I'm not trying to appear wise. I'm just as silly as you are. But that doesn't make you any less silly.
So long!
Ludwig Wittgenstein
P.S. Read this letter again from the beginning.
Good wishes!
