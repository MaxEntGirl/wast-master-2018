Dear Rhees,
Thanks so much for your very full information. I am as unclear about what I ought to do as ever, except that I think, just now the right thing is to wait & see whether this war really develops into a war or not for this still seems to me very doubtful. In case it does I suppose one will get a job with the Red Cross pretty easily & not so many occupations will be 'reserved'. But just now they actually don't need anybody & don't know whether they ever will. So no wonder if they give unclear answers. Thanks again for your kindness. Give my best wishes to Mrs Rhees.
I hope to see you soon.
Yours
Wittgenstein
