My dear Watson,
Thank you for your letter, dated Sept. 8th. I am very grateful to you for having written me so frankly. That will make it easier for me to ask you a favour again some other time when I may need it. (This may sound paradoxical but it’s true.) I think I understand the situation pretty well, and that things would have been different if Tom had come alone. My work has been going very badly for over 6 months. I’m feeling depressed and lots of things seem to be weighing on my mind. – I wish I could see you and chat with you. One of the worst things I feel is the utter hopelessness of a job like mine in these days, the utter impossibility, for a hundred reasons, to do anything like teaching philosophy to anyone.
I wish you good luck! May we meet again some day!
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
