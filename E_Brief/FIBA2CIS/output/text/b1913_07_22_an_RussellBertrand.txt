Dear Russell,
Thanks for your kind letter. My work goes on well; every day my problems get clearer now & I feel rather hopefull. All my progress comes out of the idea that the indefinables of Logic are of the general kind (in the same way as the so called Definitions of Logic are general) & this again comes from the abolition of the real variable. Perhaps you laugh at me for feeling so sanguin at present; but allthough I have not solved one of my problems I feel very, very much nearer to the solution of them all than I ever felt before. The weather here is constantly rotten, we have not yet had two fine days in succession. I am very sorry to hear that my objection to your theory of judgment paralyses you. I think it can only be removed by a correct theory of propositions. Let me hear from you soon. Yours ever etc.
L.W.
