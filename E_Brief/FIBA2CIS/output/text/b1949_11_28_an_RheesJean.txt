Dear Mrs Rhees,
A few days ago the doctors found out what is the matter with me & the source of my various troubles. It's a carcenoma of the prostate. There is, however, a medicine, certain hormones, which I am taking & which are supposed to cheque, at least, the secondary gro[w]ths in the bone marow which, I'm told, produce the anaemia. The hormones are supposed to remove many of the symptoms so that I may, in a way, get better. (The cancer is inoperable.)
I am thinking of going to Vienna if I get well enough to travel. ‒ Now I should very much like to know if & when you can put me up again. When I saw you last you didn't know how long your guest would stay. I'd be very grateful to you if you would let me hear from you. I find writing difficult just now. Please let your husband know about me. Yours sincerely
Ludwig Wittgenstein
