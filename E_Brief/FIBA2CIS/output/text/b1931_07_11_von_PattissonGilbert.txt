Dear Ludwig.
Owing to the exigencies of my work, I propose to leave England on the 25th of July, not the 18th as I said in my last letter (which I presume you got all right, though I have not received the honour of your esteemed reply), in any case pray for a favourable wind & an absence of monsoons, sea serpents & what all
Yours
Gilbert Pattisson
