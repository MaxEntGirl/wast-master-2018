Dear Moore,
Enclosed please find the photos. I don't know whether they're any d.... good, but anyhow they're easily as good as I am. One ‒ in the Botanical garden ‒ was taken in Dublin by Drury, the other two by Pattisson in France. The one on which I look like an old prophet was taken when I was rather ill. The one with the bridge in the background was taken while I was taking a photo myself. If you don't like them throw them away & I'll send you better ones when there will be some. I enclose a p.c. which shows exactly where my hutt stands though it doesn't show the hutt, which was built after the picture was taken. The scaffolding you see in the foreground does no longer exist &, I think, only bits of it existed when you saw it before the war.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
