Dear Rhees,
I'm sorry I haven't written sooner. The chief reason was that most of the time I haven't been feeling well. There's something wrong with my arms. They hurt a great part of the day & night. This has all sorts of nasty consequences. I've been to a doctor here; he says it's a neuritis & may be caused by bad teeth (although I haven't got toothache). The trouble is, I'm a total stranger here & have no way of finding out what doctor & dentist can be trusted. So although I'm in bad shape, I may have to leave the whole thing until I come to England at the end of October.
If Mrs Rhees can put me up then I could consult a doctor & a dentist in London. I could go to Cambridge, but I don't know of any good doctor there. I'm doing some philosophy, but my work's no good. I have discussions with Malcolm & some other people, & sometimes they (the discussions) aren't too bad. There are some nice walks here though nothing compared with the gower coast. Nature here doesn't look as natural as in Wales. The only thing I really enjoy here is the engineering; that's superb. I like to see American machines. The people I've met were often very nice but mostly, though not always, very foreign to me.
When I come to England I hope to see you. Give my kind regards to Mrs Rhees & ask her about the end of October. My bout, the Queen Elizabeth, leaves New York on Oct. 21st.
All good wishes!!
So long!
Ludwig Wittgenstein
Malcolm sends his kind regards.
