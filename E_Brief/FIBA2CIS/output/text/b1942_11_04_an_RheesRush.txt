Dear Rhees,
I promised you to write how my classes were going. The first two were pretty rotten, especially the first: The third & fourth (that's as far as I've got) went fairly well. I'm talking about the foundations of math.. Thouless is coming & that's a good thing. Apart from him there is, maybe, one whom I like to lecture to. There are about 10 altogether. My work here is unchanged. Roy, my mate, is still here & I'm getting on well with him, & as long as he'll be here I think I'll stick it. ‒ My lectures will probably go on moderately well as long as I am able ‒ as now ‒ to do a little work on the subject. I'm quite certain this won't be for very long.
I'm afraid I've no more time now to read any Latin, ‒ not that that worries me.
I had a letter from Drury recently from Egypt. He seems to be well & interested in his work. ‒ Give my best wishes to Mrs Rhees. I hope to hear from you before long.
Good wishes!
Ludwig Wittgenstein
