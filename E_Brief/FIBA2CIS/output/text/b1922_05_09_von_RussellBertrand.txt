Dear Wittgenstein
I have heard from my brother's wife, & she will be delighted if you will come to her Chalet in Switzerland when we are there ‒ about 8th to 20th of August, but I will let you know the exact date later ‒ certainly 15th ±ε. The address of her chalet is
Chalet Soleil, Randogne sur Sierre.
I have never been there, but I think it is above the Simplon railway, by a funicular. It will be a great happiness to see you again. My sister-in-law writes novels ‒ They used to be all about Germany ‒ "Elizabeth & her German garden" was the first ‒ She used to live in Pommern. She has quarrelled with my brother, who is difficult as a husband.
Ogden is getting on with your book, which I gather he will print both in English & German. I suppose it will be out in October. I have never read Lessing's "religiöse Streitschriften" ‒ I think they are among your books which I have in town ‒ I will look when I get home. I am sorry you have such a depressing life. All Europe is horrible since the war, but I suppose it is worse in Austria than here. One gathers that England, Germany & Russia jointly are going to fight France ‒ so it goes on.
The little boy is lovely ‒ At first he looked exactly like Kant, but now he looks more like a baby ‒ Best wishes from my wife ‒ With love,
yours ever
Bertrand Russell.
