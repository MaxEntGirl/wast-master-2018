Dear Wittgenstein ‒ I have got my passport but find great difficulties over the Dutch visa, as I dare say you do too. It seems not impossible that ‒ we may not be both able to get visas. If I fail, I will wire to you the one word "impossible". In that case, we shall have to wait till Easter, & then meet in Switzerland. I shall be very sorry if that happens. But I find (what I didn't know) that Switzerland is much easier to get to than Holland. ‒ Jolley, at Cambridge, offers £80 for your furniture, not including the books. If I go back to Cambridge, which I may do, I should probably be glad to take your furniture, or part of it. Would it suit you if I paid you £100 for the furniture & books (not including any special books that you might want returned) & then I could arrange with Jolley what I wanted to keep. I don't know whether it is legally possible to pay you yet, but I will find out. You would have to write to
B. Jolley & Sons, Bridge Str. Camb.
to say you had sold the furniture & books to me & they were to deal with me.
Please let me know as soon as you possibly can whether you can get your visa. It will be a very great disappointment if we have to put off meeting till the spring.
Yrs ever
Bertrand Russell.
