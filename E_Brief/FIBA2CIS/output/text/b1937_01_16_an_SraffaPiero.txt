Dear Sraffa, 
This is only to say that I was very glad to have a talk with you yesterday, it did me good & I was pleased, & I hope that you too felt that it went well. Thanks!
Yours 
Ludwig Wittgenstein
I had a talk with Keynes in the afternoon. Partly through my fault it did not go so well as it might have gone.
