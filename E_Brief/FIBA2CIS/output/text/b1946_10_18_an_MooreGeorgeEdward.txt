Thursday
Dear Moore,
I am very sorry I shan't be able to see you this afternoon. I have been looking forward to it; but I have a slight cold & a) I might give it to you b) I have to do everything to enable me to give a moderate lecture tomorrow. I feel, my lectures are hanging on a thin thread.
Would it be all right if I came to see you next Thursday? I hope your health is improving.
Yours ever
L. Wittgenstein
