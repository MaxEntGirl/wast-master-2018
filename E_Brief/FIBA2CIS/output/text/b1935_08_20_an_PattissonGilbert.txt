Dear Gilbert,
There are so far as I know, two words "combrous" & combersome", but no cross between them. They have, I think, different meanings, viz.: a combrous mashine will be combersome to handle. etc.
But This Only By The Way.
I am glad your leg has been making good progress. There is just one point: 'To progress' means to go ahead. Now if one of your legs goes ahead you must be careful not to leave the other behind or you would soon find yourself in some such position as this

which would be very disagreable.
My interview with Miss B. went off better than I had expected. At least I got one useful piece of information: ‒ that my only chance of getting a permission to settle in R. is to go there as a tourist & talk to officials; & that all I can do at this end is to try to get letters of introduction. Also Miss B. told me that she would give me such letters to two places. This is, on the whole, better than nothing. It doesn't however settle anything & I'm as much in the dark as ever, not only about what they'll let me do but also about what I want to do. It is shameful, but I change my mind about it every two hours. I see what a perfect ass I am, at bottom & feel rather rotten. I wish I could soon see some light.
G. bl. y.!
Yours ever bloodily
Ludwig
I hope shortly to feel like this: →
