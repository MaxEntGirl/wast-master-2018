Dear Rhees,
There is a possibility of my coming to Swansea on April 13th or 14th & staying until April 19th or 20th. Supposing I could come, would it suit you? Could I stay somewhere near you, & would you like to have discussions with me?? If, for whatever reason, my visit doesn't suit you just now, please don't for a moment hesitate to say so. I'ld only come ‒ if I can ‒ if it happens to be the right thing for you, too, & if it's all right with Mrs Rhees. Please let me know as soon as you can which way it is, so I can make my arrangements accordingly. I won't write anymore just now. I hope you're in moderately good health & in not too bad spirits. Let me hear from you soon!
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
