Dear Professor Maclagan,
Mr Rush Rhees began attending my classes on philosophy in 1935. He came to them for two or three years & during that time & in all the following years we had innumerable philosophical discussions, as well as conversations on ever so may other subjects. He has become a close personal friend of mine.
He has an excellent grasp of philosophical problems & is keenly interested in a great variety of philosophical subjects - including moral & political philosophy about which he has thought a great deal & is, I believe, extremely well read.
He investigates philosophical problems in a fruitful way, i.e., a way which promises definite progress, as opposed to a mere moving in circles.
I am certain that he is as good a teacher as could be found - most conscientious, taking great personal interest in the welfare of his students, indefatigable, patient & patient in discussion.
That he has not published philosophical writings ought not, in my opinion, to count against him. His reluctance to publish is not due to a lack of fruitful thoughts but to a very rare amount of self-criticism.
Mr Rhees has a very exceptional character. He is kindly, most serious, conscientious to a fault, - an excellent colleague & friend.
Any Philosophical Department should be proud of having him amongst its members.
Yours sincerely, 
L.Wittgenstein
