Dear Ogden,
Thanks so much for your letter & the books which arrived yesterday. They realy look very nice. I wish their contents were half as good as their external apearance.
I'm affrayd there is no hope that you will ever be repaied in any way for the lots of trouble you took with my stuff.
I hope you will get Mrs Pinsents address from Richie. Otherwise, curse him from me.
I'm sure Johnson won't buy my book. Though I should like to know what he thinks about it. If you see him please give him my love.
I hope to hear from you again before too long.
Yours sincerely
Ludwig Wittgenstein
P.S. 
My address has changed again; it is now: L. W. Lehrer in Puchberg am Schneeberg. Nieder Österreich.
