Dear Rhees,
I got your letter a little less than a week ago in Oxford where I was staying with Smythies. I intend to stay here until Sept. 8th when I shall fly to Vienna. I am sorry not to have answered before. The chief reason is that, in a number of ways, I'm feeling queer. One cause of this is that my nights aren't good, but there are other causes. Unless something very unexpected happens I shall not come to Swansea in the near future. I should like to see you, yet dread making any arrangements at present. After I return from Austria, on Sept. 29th, I intend to stay in England for some weeks to dictate some of the stuff I wrote in Ireland. I hope that perhaps during that time we shall be able to meet. God knows! This is a queer letter, but no queerer than it's writer. Perhaps in a few days I shall feel a bit more rational & settled down; if so I'll write again & more rationally. Please forgive me my stupidity. As always
L. Wittgenstein
