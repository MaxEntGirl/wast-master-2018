Dear Professor Feigl,
Thank you for your letter of May 15th. My article in the Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society on ‘logical form’ was written at a time when I was just beginning to change my views which I had expressed in my book “Tractatus Logico-Phil.” That article is, therefore, representative only of a kind of hesitaon & does not represent either my former or my later views. I, therefore, most decidedly do not wish it to be reprinted & cannot give you the permission to use it in your anthology
