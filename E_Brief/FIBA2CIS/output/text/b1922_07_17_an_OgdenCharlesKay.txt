17.7.22.
Dear Ogden,
Thanks for your letter dated 6.7. and all good news about the book. I've left Trattenbach now. My present address is: L.W. bei Frau Mima Sjögren XIII. St. Veitgasse 17. Wien This will allways find me. Letters to Trattenbach will be forwarded too. I should like to see Sprott and have a chat with him about the Cambridge people, and I should very much like to hear from Ritchie again after such a long time.
I hope to see Russell during the holidaies
Yours sincerely
Ludwig Wittgenstein
