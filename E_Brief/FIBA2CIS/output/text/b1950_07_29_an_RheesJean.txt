Dear Mrs Rhees,
My Norwegian journey is off. Ben Richards decided to take his London exam again at the end of September. So he's got to cram & can't have a holiday. I've cancelled the passages. Maybe we'll go in October.
Could you put me up next weekend? I.e., from Sat. to Monday? If not, please write me a line. Hope to see you soon.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
