1.7.12.
Dear Russell
Thank you very much for your kind letter.
Will you think that I have gone mad if I make the following suggestion?: The sign (x).φx is not a complete symbol but has meaning only in an inference of the kind: from  follows ψa. Or more general: from  follows φ(a). I am ‒ of course ‒ most uncertain about the matter but something of the sort might really be true. I am sorry I cannot spend as much time on thinking about this stuff as I would like to because I have to write a most absurd paper on rythms for the psychological meeting on the 13th. — I hear just now that a sister of mine is going to visit me here on the 6th. Would you mind me introducing her to you? She ought to see every thing worth seeing!
Yours most etc
Ludwig Wittgenstein
