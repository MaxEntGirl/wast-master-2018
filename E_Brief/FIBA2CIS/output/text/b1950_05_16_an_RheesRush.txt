Dear Rhees,
Thank you for your 2 letters & the typewritten notes. I've read them through once & made remarks on the margin to some of them. I want to read them some more, make some more remarks & then send them to you. Not that what I write is much use but it might help to clear up some things.
So long! & good wishes!
Ludwig Wittgenstein
