Dear Rhees,
Thanks so much for your letter & wish. I intend to go to Cambridge about the middle of next week & I should like to leave there as soon as possible. There may possibly be one catch. You know I am on leave of absence here & it has been granted me because I am doing "important" war work. If, e.g., I leave here & try to find another job, say in a hospital, I have to let the General Board know & they have to approve the new job. Now if I come to Cambridge next week they'll want to know what I'm doing & I'll have to tell them that I want to do some philosophy for a couple of months. And in this case they can say: if you want to do philosophy you're not doing a war job & have to do your philosophy in Cambridge. I'm awfully sorry that I haven't thought of this before. It only dawned upon me today. Not for any particular reason. I just thought of it. A few days ago I wrote to Broad asking if I could stay in College for a few days & telling him the reason. I've not yet had a reply &, perhaps, when I get it he'll write something about this business. I imagine I could say I need a rest & take a two months holiday. I just don't know what the University does in such a case & shall have to see next week. I'm almost shure that I couldn't work at Cambridge now! I hope I'll be able to come to Swansea. ‒ Drury is in Swansea now & perhaps you've already seen him. Thanks again for your great kindness!
So long!
Ludwig Wittgenstein
