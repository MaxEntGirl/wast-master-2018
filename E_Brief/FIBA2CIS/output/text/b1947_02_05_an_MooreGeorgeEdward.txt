5.2.
Dear Moore,
I'm having a cold now, or rather, a sore throat. It isn't bad at all but I very much want to get rid of it by the end of the week & I think I'd better stay at home. So I shan't see you tomorrow. If I don't hear from you, & nothing unexpected happens, I'll come Thursday next week.
I hope you're well again & keeping that way in spite of this bl. â€’ weather.
So long!
Ludwig Wittgenstein
