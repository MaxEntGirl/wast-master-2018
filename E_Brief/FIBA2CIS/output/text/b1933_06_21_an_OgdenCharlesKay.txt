Dear Ogden,
On May the 20th I got a letter from Kegan Paul saying that the first edition of my book was now nearly exhausted & that they were about to print a new one. They mentioned in their letter certain corrections which Ramsey had made & I had authorised & asked whether I wished to make any further alterations. I replied on May 27th that I did not know what Ramseys corrections were & that I wanted to see them before the new edition went into print. I then did not hear from Kegan Paul until today when they write to me, would I "be good enough to return to them the corrected proofs of Tractatus L-Ph... These are now required urgently". Now this obviously makes no sense as they haven't sent me any proofs & some feeling warns me that they want to play a trick on me. So would you be so good to step in & help clear up this matter.
Yours sincerely
Ludwig Wittgenstein
