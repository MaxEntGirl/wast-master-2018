Dear Moore,
Thanks for your letter. I'm sorry I shan't hear the Bruckner now. Poor Tim! â€’ I think I understand your remark about the Schubert, & I feel something I could express in the same words. I believe it's something like this, that the Quintet has a phantastic kind of greatness. Is this what you'ld say? By the way, it was played by far better than I had expected.
So long! Good wishes!
Yours
L. Wittgenstein
