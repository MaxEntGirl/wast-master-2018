Dear Wittgenstein ‒ Thanks for your letter, which arrived today. I will send back your book in a few days: I was waiting to know which address to send it to. I have not written things in the blank pages, except once or twice, because talk will be much better. I studied the book rather carefully, & I think now I do fairly understand it. But we shall see. I shall send it to your new address.
It is terrible to think of your having to earn your living, but I am not surprised by your action. I am much poorer too. They say Holland is very expensive but I suppose we can endure a week of it without going bankrupt. I find the time that would suit me best would be before Christmas, about Dec. 13-20 ‒ I ought to be back in England for Christmas. I will set about getting permission, & shall assume that date. It may turn out that Switzerland would be better. ‒ Tell your publisher from me that he is a low scoundrel! My dear Wittgenstein it will be a joy to see you again after all these years ‒ In all friendship,
yours ever
Bertrand Russell.
