Dear Norman,
Thanks for your letter & thanks for sending me van Houten's cocoa. I'm looking forward to drinking it. ‒ I, too, was greatly impressed when I first read Freud. He's extraordinary. ‒ Of course he is full of fishy thinking & his charm & the charm of the subject is so great that you may easily be fooled.
He always stresses what great forces in the mind, what strong prejudices work against the idea of psycho-analysis. But he never says what an enormoues charm that idea has for people, just as it has for Freud himself. There may be strong prejudices against uncovering something nasty, but sometimes it is infinitely more attractive than it is repulsive. Unless you think very clearly psycho-analysis is a dangerous & a foul practice, & it's done no end of harm &, comparatively, very little good. (If you think I'm an old spinster ‒ think again!) ‒ All this, of course, doesn't detract from Freud's extraordinary scientific achievment. Only, extraordinary scientific achievments have a way, these days, of being used for the destruction of human beings. (I mean their bodies, or their souls, or their intelligence). So hold on to your brains.
The painting of the enclosed Xmas card has given me great trouble. The thick book is my collected works.
Smythies sends his best wishes.
Lots of good luck! May we see each other again!
Affectionately
Ludwig
