Tuesday
Dear Moore,
I'm sorry I didn't come to you to day but I didn't feel quite well enough for it. Mrs Moore wrote to me that you too were having 'flue. I hope it was only a light attack. With me a 'flue, however short, has a long epilogue. And I'm just in the beginning of it. When I shall be well enough I'll come round & try to see you, for I'm sure you'ld better stay at home for several days.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
