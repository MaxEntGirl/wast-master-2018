Dear Miss Cartwright,
Thanks very much for your letter & the paper on 'Number'. I wonder if you would allow me to discuss it next Wednesday in our class. It would come in very useful indeed. It's the only way of getting anything out of these classes to try to formulate your thoughts on a subject yourself, & then have them pulled to bits. For if they can stand the pulling, all the better. I cann't pick holes if there aren't any. In case you don't object to my discussing your paper on Wednesday, please don't bother to reply
Yours sincerely
Ludwig Wittgenstein
