Dear Rhees,
I have arrived safely. This afternoon's my first lecture. Oh Hell! I bought the Hibbert Journal. Ewing's article is quite different from what I expected. It's stupidish & academical but not unkind. It treated the Germans as prospective inmates of a reformatory school, managed on modern, humane principles. In fact the whole tone of the Journal surprised me as being rather human.
Well, wish me good luck! & the same to you! Give the Philos. Society my blessing.
Let me hear from you. Thanks for your kindness during my stay! So long!
Ludwig Wittgenstein
