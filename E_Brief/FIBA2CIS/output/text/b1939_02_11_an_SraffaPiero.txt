Dear Sraffa,
I’ve been appointed prof.. I hope the future will show that I wasn’t wrong in applying for the post; for, of course, what drove me to it was to a great part (if not alltogether) vanity. However it’s no use crying over spilt milk & I must hope for the best. – One obvious disadvantage which the appointment has for me is that it makes your forecast correct, & you will therefore be more cocksure than ever in our future discussions. However that also serves me right. If I don’t hear from you to the contrary I shall come to you on Tuesday at the usual time.
So long!
Professor Wittgenstein
