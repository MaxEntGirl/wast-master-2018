Text: 
Dear Russell,
My mother will stay at the Savoy Hotel. So we shall expect you there on wednesday about 1-15. By the by, please remember that my mother must not know that I was operated last July (if by any chance the conversation should turn on such topics) 
I can now express my objection to your theory of judgment exactly: I believe it is obvious that, from the prop. "A judges that (say) a is in the Rel. R to b", if correctly analysed, the prop " " must follow directly without the use of any other premis. This condition is not fullfiled by your theory.
Yours ever
L. W.
