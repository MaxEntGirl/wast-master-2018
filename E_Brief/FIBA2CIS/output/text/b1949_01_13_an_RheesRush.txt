Dear Rhees,
I had a letter from Richards two days ago, saying that he had received my present: Thanks! Last Sunday I, too, fell ill with a mild gastric flue & I've heard since that there are lots of other cases about. I'm out of bed today, at least so far. I still worked on Sunday but not after that, & I may not be able to work for quite a time. ‒ Last Friday I had my talk with Drury's boss. I made things very clear, & he seemed to listen & took it in a kind spirit, but I very much doubt if it's done any good. I don't like the look of things at all. ‒ I hope you are better. I know that flu has a long aftermath. Good wishes!
Ludwig Wittgenstein
