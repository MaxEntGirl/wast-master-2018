Today. (That's all I know)
My dear Norman,
Thanks for your letter of Feb. 6th. As you see I'm in Cambridge; I'm staying with my doctor who is an extremely kind man & an excellent doctor. I also saw a speciallist here & I'm to have deep X-ray treatment again, this time for my spine. I've had a pretty bad time at Oxford but am feeling much better now (for reasons no one knows), I have very little pain & discomfort. ‒ Yes, the Bouwsmas were angelic, & so was Miss Anscombe. I'm not sure how long I shall stay here. It'll depend on how things go. ‒ I believe I wrote to you that before I fell ill I intended to go to Norway to try to work there. I'd even taken a ticket to Bergen. I don't know if I'll ever get well enough to do this; probably not. In this case I shall probably go back to Oxford from here. I can't even think of work at present, & it doesn't matter, if only I don't live too long! I'm not depressed though. von Wright came to see me twice. If he knew I was writing to you he'd send you his very best wishes & so would Smythies & Miss Anscombe.
I wish I could have a talk again with you, Doney & Nelson. But even if I could be with you you'd find that my head was empty. (It was half empty already when I was in Ithaca.) Please give my kind regards to D. & N. & to Dr Mooney. I like to think of her & I always praise her when I talk of her. ‒ Give my love to L. & R. & C..
As always, affectionately
Ludwig
