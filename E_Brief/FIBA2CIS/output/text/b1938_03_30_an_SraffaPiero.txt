Dear Sraffa,
The situation is roughly this:
I’ve had now a good many letters from home none of them containing any alarming news about my friends & relations there. So I think I needn’t trouble you to go there & see them. One of my sisters who at present is in New York will return to Vienna in a week or a fortnight's time & I have arranged to meet her on her way home in Southampton or Paris.
As to my naturalisation nothing definite has been done so far for reasons it would be very lengthy to explain in a letter. I have however no reason to think that I don’t have a good chance. I have not yet been approached by the consulate.
I intend to stay here during the vac & expect to be invited to lecture next term.
Let me know when you come back.
Thanks for all the trouble you took over my business.
Best wishes!!
Yours 
Ludwig Wittgenstein
