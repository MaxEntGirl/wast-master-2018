Dear Moore,
Thanks for your letter & for having fulfilled both promises. My executors are Rhees & Burnaby of Trinity.
I wish you all good luck!
Yours
L. Wittgenstein
Rhees leaves me tomorrow. He sends his love & respects, & so does Drury. I can still work fairly well though not as I did a month ago.
