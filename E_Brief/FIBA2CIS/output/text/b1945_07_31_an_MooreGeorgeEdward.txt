Text: 
Dear Moore,
This copy is lousy, but it's all I can get. Probably you have the 'Studien' already, then just throw these away. My favourites are NÂ° 4 & 5.
5 must be played very crisply & with a serious expression, not as though it were meant, in some way, to be witty.
Yours
L. Wittgenstein
P.S. The Marmalade is grand & not at all bitter.
