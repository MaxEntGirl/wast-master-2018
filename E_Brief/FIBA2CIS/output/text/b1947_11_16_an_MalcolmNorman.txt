Text: 
TRINITY COLL. CAMB.
16.11.47.
My dear Norman,
As soon as I returned here from Austria I tendered my resignation to the Vice Chancellor & I shall cease to be professor on Dec. 31st. at 12 p.m. Whatever happens to me (& I'm not at all sanguine about my future) I feel I did the only natural thing. I intend to leave here for Ireland in about 3 weeks. I don't know what my address will be, but "Trinity Coll. Cambridge" will always find me. I'm very busy these days; chiefly, dictating stuff I wrote during the last 2-3 years. It's mostly bad but I want to have it with me in a handy form. â€’ I'm seeing Moore once a week. I like being with him almost more than ever. Somehow we seem to understand each other better. He is alternately well & a little ill & has to take it easy.
I'll write more some time soon. Just now I'm always in a hurry. Give my warmest wishes to Lee & Raymond. Good luck!
Affectionately
Ludwig
I had an impertinent letter from Lazerovitz reproaching me for not letting him know beforehand about my resignation. He told me that this showed a 'shocking' 'fault of character' & that I was 'a gross person'. I replied & tried to tell him 'where he gets off'. He seems to be an ass.
So long! Let me hear from you before long!
The above.
