Dear Roland,
I just had your letter dated [...]. I wrote to you a few days ago explaining why I hadn't written sooner. ‒ I never had any particulary book in mind when I wrote to you: would you like me to send you a book; & as in your reply you didn't mention any particular book. I took it that you didn't want me to send you one. I expected you to suggest a book if you wanted one.
About the 'Imitation' you're wrong. I've never read the book nor did I take it to Russia. I believe you're mixing it up with Tolstoy's 'Short explanation of the gospels'.
I hope I shall see you when you're on leave & I hope it'll be good for both of us! I wonder what the surprise is you mention in your letter. Is it by any chance a mustache or beard that you've been growing? I hope it isn't. For I don't like people to change their faces; par[t]icularly when they are liable to change their souls! ‒ To return to the book question: I don't know What book might be 'good for you'. You once mentioned that you had read in the 'Pilgrim's Progress' & enjoyed it. If you like I could send you that. Let me know. ‒ Francis' leg is steadily improving & so is mine.
As to your letters I should like to say this: one word that comes from your heart would mean more to me than 3 pages out of your head!
Good wishes as always!
Ludwig
