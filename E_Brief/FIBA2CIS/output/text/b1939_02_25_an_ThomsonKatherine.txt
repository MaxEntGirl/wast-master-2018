Dear Mrs Thomson,
It was very nice to get your kind congratulations. I must say however that I’m not feeling at all  optimistic about the success of my election. I feel my brain is aging, & I won’t be much use to anyone in a very short time.
Lots of good wishes to you & George. Skinner sends his best wishes too.
Yours sincerely
Ludwig Wittgenstein
