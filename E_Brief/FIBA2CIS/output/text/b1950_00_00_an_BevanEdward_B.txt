Text: 
Dear Doctor,
If you have these records already, or if you don’t like them, they can be exchanged at Miller’s. If you have this symphony but not this recording play the second movement & the third & the fourth & maybe you’ll like this recording better than the one you have (if any). I think the performance is pretty good though not perfect. 
I’ve only come here for a couple of days to see Ben after his exam. You know the result & what I feel about it. Thanks for your great kindness!
So long!
Ludwig Wittgenstein
