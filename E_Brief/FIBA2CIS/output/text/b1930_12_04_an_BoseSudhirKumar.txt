My dear Bose,
I thought of writing to you long ago but never had the energy to go up to the porter's lodge of Magdalene to enquire about your address. However today I did. I have not been exceedingly well this term having colds & influenza. But now I've had my last lecture thank God and shall go down (to Vienna) in 3 days. Before I go down however something agreeable is going to happen to me: I'm going to be made a Fellow of Trinity the day after tomorrow. This, as you will imagine, is very gratifying to me. I hope you are well & getting on allright. Let me know something about you soon.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
