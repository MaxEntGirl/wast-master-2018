Text: 
Dear Moore,
I am in Vienna now, doing the most loathsome work of dictating a synopsis from my manuscripts. It is a terrible bit of work & I feel wretched doing it. I saw Russell the other day at Petersfield &, against my original intention, started to explain to him Philosophy. Of course we couldn't get very far in two days but he seemed to understand a little bit of it. My plan is to go & see him in Cornwall on the 22nd or 23rd of April & to give him the synopsis & a few explanations. Now my lectures begin on Monday the 28th & I want to know if it is all right if I come to Cambridge not before the 26th. Please write to me about this as soon as possible as I have to make my plans accordingly. I am kindhearted therefore I wish you a good vacation although I haven't a good one myself.
Yours ever
Ludwig Wittgenstein
