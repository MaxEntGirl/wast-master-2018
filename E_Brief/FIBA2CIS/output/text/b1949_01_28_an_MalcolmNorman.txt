Dear Norman,
I'm really ashamed of asking the question which I'm writing to ask you. ‒ Some time before Christmas I ordered a cheap little book through a Dublin bookseller. The title is "The Journals of George Fox" & it had appeared in Dent's 'Everyman's Library'. If it wasn't out of print, Dents in London were to send it straight to you (with a X-mas card from me). I thought you mightn't have it & that it might interest you. ‒ Towards the end of December I called again at the book shop & was told that Dents had replied they couldn't send the book to America but that a firm, Dutton in New York, supplied America with the 'Everyman's Library'. I was told that they had already written to Dutton about it. By a mere chance I glanced into their ordre book & I saw that all the address they had put down was "Dr Malcolm, Ithaca N.Y." ‒ I gave them a piece of my mind & again your full address, & they promised to write to Dutton immediately. ‒ Did you get the book? ‒ I have no doubt, the card I gave the Dublin people was lost, so, even if you got the book, you couldn't have known who sent it.
I had a pretty good run of work in the last 3 months, or so, but I fell ill with some sort of infection of the intestines about 3 weeks ago & it hasn't yet cleared up. If it goes on for another week I shall consult a specialist. Of course it hasn't done my work any good. I had to interrupt it completely for a week & after that it just crawled along, as I do when I take a walk, these days.
I hope you're all well, or moderately well. It would be good to see you again before long!
Give my good wishes to Lee & Raymond.
Affectionately
Ludwig
