Dear Rhees,
I write this with pencil because I'm in bed; I have been bad for quite a time. ‒ I really don't remember whether I thanked you for the nice socks you gave me at Christmas. I'm even more muddled these days than usual. Thanks anyway. I was very glad to get a present from you. The trouble partly was that I was ill at Christmas lying in my good doctor's house at Cambridge. There, by the way, I read a book which interested me & which I liked. It's called "Rommel" & is a kind of biography of the German general written by a brigadier Young. It seemed to me rather well written & with great fairness.
I hope you will have a moderately good Lent Term. Good wishes as always,
Ludwig Wittgenstein
