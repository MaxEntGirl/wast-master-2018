About 2 month ago I wrote to you asking you to write to me about Johnsons lecture, & I haven't got an answer yet. Isn't that a shame? Also I should like to know how you are & when the Easter vac's begin. Have you ever thought about the nature of a tautology? That's what I am now bothered with.
Now do write to me soon & much!
Yours etc, etc
Ludwig Wittgenstein
P.S. I am now learning to Ski & find it great fun.
