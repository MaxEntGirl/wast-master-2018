Dear Rhees,
Thanks for your letter. I haven't heard anything from home so far that makes the situation any clearer. I shall just have to wait. ‒
As you know, I wish you lots of good luck with your writing. Just stick to it; &, if possible, sacrifice coherence sometimes. I mean, if you feel you could just now say something, but it isn't exactly the thing which ought to come in this place ‒ rather say it & jump about a bit than stick to the 'single track' & not get on. That is, if you can do it. If you can't jump, just plod on. You've still got a damn good chance to make it. And if you can't finish it, send it in nevertheless.
So long!
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
