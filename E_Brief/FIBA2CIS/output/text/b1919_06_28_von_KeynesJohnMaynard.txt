My dear Wittgenstein,
Your book has safely reached me and I am forwarding it immediately to Russell. As soon as peace is safely signed, is there any good likelihood of our seeing you in England?
I had nearly finished my book on Probability in the summer of 1914 and most of it, indeed, was actually in print. But the war stopped all such thoughts. I hope now soon to take it up again and at last publish early next year.
Yours ever,
JM Keynes
