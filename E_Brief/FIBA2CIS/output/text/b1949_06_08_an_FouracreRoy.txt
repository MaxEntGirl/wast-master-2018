Dear Roy, 
Thanks for your letter. I haven't written for a long time because I've been ill & still am. I have a very severe anaemia the cause of which isn't known. I'm taking iron & liverextrat, but if I'm getting better at all it's a very slow process. I haven't been able to work for over three months. I'd been feeling lousy for a long time before they made a blood test & found what was the matter. That only happened 3 weeks ago. ‒ I may be in London in about 3 weeks & perhaps I can see you then. I'd like it very much. ‒ I'm sorry to hear the atmosphere at Guy's is getting worse. It's difficult to imagine. I hope you'll find a decent job.
So long! G. bl. y..
Ludwig
