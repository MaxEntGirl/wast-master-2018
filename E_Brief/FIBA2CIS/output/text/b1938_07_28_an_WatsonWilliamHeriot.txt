My dear Watson,
You haven't heard from me for ages and this letter too is only going to be exceedingly short. A friend of mine Mr. J. C. Taylor from Toronto may be passing through Montreal and I want to recommend him most warmly to you. He has been studying philosophy here and is an excellent man in every way. Please give him any assistance you can if he should come to you. - I am very well, as far as health and work goes, but greatly worried by events in Austria. I will write more before long.
Best wishes!!
Yours ever
Ludwig Wittgenstein
