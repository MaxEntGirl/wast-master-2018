Dear Wittgenstein
Your letter of the 2nd April reached me yesterday.
Your manuscript is quite safe. I left it in England in the hopes of getting it printed, I do not know with what success. It is in the hands of Miss Wrinch of Girton, who is a good mathematician & a student of mathematical logic.
I am sorry you find the people in your neighbourhood so disagreeable. I don't think average human nature is up to much any where, & I daresay wherever you were you would find your neighbours equally obnoxious.
I have been in bed for the last ten weeks with a severe illness, but am now nearly well, & am returning to England this summer, so address there if you write again.
I am determined to get your manuscript published, & if it has not been achieved during my absence, I will take the matter in hand as soon as I return.
I wish you could come to England some time & pay me a visit, but I suppose that would be very difficult for you. I shall have to come to Trattenbach which, from the picture, looks quite a pretty place.
Best love, my dear Wittgenstein
Yours ever,
Bertrand Russell.
