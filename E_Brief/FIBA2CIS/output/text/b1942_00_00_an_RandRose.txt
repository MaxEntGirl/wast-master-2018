Dear Miss Rand,
Some weeks ago I received a book, "Tonio Kröger" from you. Thank you – because I know you meant well. But you know that I don’t wish to get presents from you & you should have respected my wish. When I got the book I debated with myself whether I should just send it back to you. I kept it, not because I wanted or needed it, but because sending it back seemed an unkind Thing to do, as I knew you meant well. Another time I will send any present back, however much trouble this may give me; so, please, stop sending me things. The money which you wrote you had received was not from me, by the way. – The reason I’m writing now, however, Isn’t to tell you all This but to say that to-morrow, Friday at 5 o.c. there will be a discussion in my room. If you should like to come, do. The discussion won’t be much good as I’m still weak.
Yours sincerely 
L. Wittgenstein
