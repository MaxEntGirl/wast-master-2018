Dear Roland,
If you come to see me, please come this week-end. A room will be free in this house over the week-end & it wouldn't be so easy to find a room anywhere else in Town as Newcastle is congested with army navy etc. Please write me when you'll arrive. I may not be able to meet the train, so here is how you get to the above address. Right outside the station is a tram stop. As you leave the station the tram you want runs to the right. You take a car marked "Gosforth" or "Gosforth Park". Either of these takes you to the corner of West Avenue. The tram stop is called "County Buildings" so tell the conductor to give you a shout at County Buildings. You then walk up to N° 19 West Avenue & ring the bell.
So long! & good luck!
Ludwig
