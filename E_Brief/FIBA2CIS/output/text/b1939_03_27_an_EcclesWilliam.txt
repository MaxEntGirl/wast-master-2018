My dear Eccles
Thanks for your letter. Yes, it's me. â€’ I should very much like to see you &, curiously enough, I was talking to someone about you yesterday. I'ld like to come to you in the Easter vac, which is on now; but I think it'll probably be impossible. I'm waiting for my naturalisation to go through. I applied for it about 10 months ago & it's due now. If I can get my (British) passport in a week or two from now I shall try to go to Vienna with it for a week or two to see my sisters who live there and are in a difficult & dangerous situation. For, although I can't really help them they'll be glad to see me again.
Having got the professorship is very flattering & all that but it might have been very much better for me to have got a job opening & closing crossing gates. I don't get any kick out of my position (except what my vanity & stupidity sometimes gets).
Well perhaps I can see you in the summer if not now. I'ld like to see your children too, particularly Hugh.
So long, & thanks again for your letter. Please remember me to Mrs Eccles.
Yours ever
Ludwig Wittgenstein
