Dear Ogden,
I am very sorry I could not send you the proofs before today. They were forwarded to me to Vienna and had to be sent to Hallein near Salzburg where I am staying just now with an onkle of mine. So they just arrived the day before yesterday.
I have looked through carefully all your notes and made my remarks where it was necessary. But as there was not sufficient room to explain myself in the margin I wrote them on a separate sheet which you will find enclosed.
I then read through the whole of the German text and of course found a good many faults which I corrected on the proof itself without mentioning them on a separate sheet. I hope theese corrections are all of them intelligible. Several faults were made in separating sylables in german words when one half of the word stands on one line the other half on the next.
Now there was one difficulty in correcting the German: I havn't got my manuscript here. Therefore it often happened that I was not quite sure whether the text was right or wrong. Now in such cases I put a sign such ← to the line in which I suspect a fault or about which I am not quite certain at any rate and the arrow means: "please look up this line in the original and see if it's right!" Especially it often happened that I was not sure about the punctuation in this case I put a sign "P←" before the line. So please compare the punctuation in these lines carefully with that of the original. Of course the arrow doesn't mean that there is a fault but it just means that I'm not quite certain if there is or not. In cases where I could easily explain my doubts I wrote some quearies in the margin which ‒ please ‒ examine carefully.
As to your note about the Italian monastery etc. etc., do as you please; only I cann't for my life see the point of it. Why should the general reviewer know my age? Is it as much as to say: You cann't expect more of a young chap especially when he writes a book in such a noise as must have been on the Austrian front? If I knew that the general reviewer believed in astrology I would suggest to print the date and hour of my birth in front of the book that he might set the horoscope for me. (26/IV 1889. 6 p.m)
I look forward very much to see Russell the day after tomorrow in Innsbruck. My address is as usual: L. W. bei Frau Mima Sjögren XIII. St. Veitgasse 17, Wien.
Yours sincerely
Ludwig Wittgenstein
2.0123 If it isn't unenglish leave "know". It is used here in the sense in which one says "I know this man". If you will put "am acquainted" for it the prop must run thus: "If I am acquainted with an object, then I also know all its..." that means in the second occurrence there must be "know". "To know" means both: kennen and wissen and "to be acquainted with" ‒ I think ‒ hasn't exactly the meaning I want, because it seems to me to imply somehow that one knows a lot about an object, while to know here just means: I know it but I needn't know anything about it.
2.01231 As above: In the first occurrence you might put "be acquainted with", in the second leave "know".
2.02331. I don't think "without trouble" is good. I think the word "strai[gh]t away" has the right meaning. It would then run: "...one can distinguish it strai[gh]t away from the others by...".
2.06 Yes, this prop. means "Reality is the existence and nonexistence of atomic facts". But couldn't we leave it as it is with "the"? I think it suits the precedent prop. better. But do as you like about it.
2.181 Put "a"
3.203 If you put the full stop after "meaning" there must be one in the bracket too.
3.261 Put: "Nor any sign which..."
3·326 I think "significant" is alright here. The meaning of this prop. is: that in order to recognize the symbol in a sign we must look at how this sign is used significantly in propositions. I.e. we must observe how the sign is used in accordance with the laws of logical syntax. Thus "significant" here means as much as "syntactically correct".
3.331 No, this isn't meant imperatively. Put "into" for "to".
3.34. Did I underline "welche allein" in the German?! If so, it ought to be gesperrt. If not, I don't know what was in my head when I underlined the English. If I didn't underline the German don't put italics in the English.
4.041 You might put "get outside it" instead of "get away from it".
4.0411 In the 3rd line leave out brackets in "Gen. fx". "Determine" does mean something like discover here. We cann't distinguish between the two variables, we cann't find out which is which.
4.0621. Couldn't the two "~" in "(~~p=p)" be printed slightly nearer together? In the German they are a little nearer. They could allways be as close together as the "~" is to "p". There needn't be a biger space between "~" and "~" than between "~" and "p".
4.112 If "to make" is better, please put it in. The whole, of course, is a Zeugma and there ought to be a substantive after "but" to match with "a number of...". But I suppose that cann't be done.
4.1273 See proof: "aRb", "(∃x) : aRx.xRb", "(∃x,y) : aRx.xRy.yRb" are quite separate symbols they must therefore be slightly further apart from one another.
4.4 Omit "the".
4.465 "essence" is alright
4.466 leave "symbols"
5.02 It realy ought to be "+c" not "+c". "c" is a suffix"
5.101 Put: "p. ~q : ∨ : q. ~p"
In the first line of the schema there should be square brackets round p ⊃ p . q ⊃ q. It doesn't matter that they are not square in the German. In the last line of the schema the round brackets want closing and there must be a bigger space between them and the square ones, just as in the top line. In the bottom line in the German please put "(p . ~p . q. ~q)" instead of "(p. ~p . ~q. q)"
5.1361 Don't print "Superstition" in italics! But leave the German "Aberglaube" gesperrt.
5.1362 "known" is alright here.
5.155 Put "unit". Oughtn't there to be a colon in the first line of this prop. before the capital "The" at the end of the line as in the German before "Die Umstände..."?
5.3 Omit "the".
5.42 The last part of this prop ought to run: "And it is obvious that the "⊃" which we define by means of "~" and "∨" is identical with that by w[h]ich we define "∨" with the help of "~" and that this "∨" is the same as the first, and so on." Thus your correction in the German is quite right only in the last case there ought to be "∨" instead of "~" in the German and in the English.
5.473 I believe it ought to be "some" here. One might say in a similar sense: "the prop. is senseless because there is some arbitrary determination which we have not made". I hope you can leave it as it is.
5.511 I suppose it should be "connected into". I didn't mean "connected with" but: connected to one another in such a way as to form an infinitely fine network. Could one say "I connect these bits of string into a network" meaning, I connect them in such a way as to form a network?
5.521 I mean "separate" and not "derive". They were connected and I separate them.
5.5261 "(∃x, ϕ) etc" not "(∃x. ϕ) etc".
The bracket schould stand at the end of the prop..
Put "A characteristic of a composite symbol..." as you suggested.
5.5303 Yes, this schould be "Roughly speaking:"
5.532 In the German in should be "...; und nicht...
5.5563 "image" has the meaning of "simile" here. So you may put "simile".
6.121 "into" is right.
6.36111 The figure schould be thus
-----o—x-----x—o-----
 a b
I.e. the little cross and the circle should be just at the end of each line and not at a distance from it [x↙——↘o] and they should be quite small; for they should just mark that the two ends of each line are different.
4.1272 Look at my correction. Here the commas and quotation marks are printed wrongly! It mustn't be "'Complex,' 'Fact,' etc etc" but: "'Complex', 'Fact', 'Function', 'Number', etc" Similar nonsense you find above in the same prop.! And in the German too. Please note this point when you look through the stuff again.
4.1273 In the 8th line from the top of this prop.: Is there a comma wanted after "series", and ought it to be between the word and the quotation marks?
4.24 In the German exactly as in the English:
"'fx', 'ϕ(x,y)', etc." in the English
"'fx', 'ϕ(x,y)', etc" in the German.
4.241 I wonder what has got into the printers head!
4.1252 The same faults. In the German it is alright.
4.0411        "        "        "
4.441        "        "        "
4.442        "        "        " If possible don't separate (TTFT) from (p,q) they ought to stand on the same line. The space between them should not be biger than it is in the German.
5.02        "        "        " (First line)
There is a fault in the translation of this prop. caused perhaps by a misprint in the German. It must not be: "The index is always part of a description of the object whose names we attach to it..." but: "...of the object to whose name we attach it...". We don't attach the names of the object to the index but the index to the name of the object!
5.242 ", " " ",
        wrong        right
5.31 The same fault
5.2523  "      "      "   5.534
5.42    "     "     "   5.535
5.44    "     "     "   5.5352
5.451   "     "     "   5.541
5.46    "     "     "   5.542
5.47    "     "     "   5.631
5.473   "     "     "   5.641
5.501   "     "     "   6.1201
5.502   "     "     "   6.1203
5.512   "     "     "   6.1221
5.513   "     "     "   6.1232
5.515                         6.3211
5.525                         6.36
5.5301                        3.312
5.531                         3.333
5.532
5.512 In the 5th line from the top "p" is left out after "~". It should be: "That which denies in "~p"..."
5.5321 In this prop ‒ I'm affraid ‒ something must be altered (it is my fault). Instead of what I have crossed out it must be:
"(∃x).fx.⊃.fa : ~(∃x,y).fx.fy"
