Dear Eccles,
As you'll observe I'm in Vienna again for a holiday. Thanks for your letter. Your designs are splendid as far as I can judge. I will make a few remarks:
the wardrobe: Why is the horizontal crosspiece in the doors not in the middle (from top to Bottom) such that top & bottom panels are of same length? 2) I think it might perhaps be more convenient to rest the wardrobe on a low (~ 3") foot as is done in the man[u]facturers design instead of the doors opening right on the carpet.
MEDICINE CHEST: splendid.
DRESSING TABLE: "      "
I can't see any drawing of a bed; or do you wish to take the one which the furniture man[u]facturers submitted? If so do insist that they cut off all those beastly fancy ends.  Zeichnung   And why should the Bed stand on rollers? You're not going to travel about with it in your house!? By all means have the other things made after your design!
I hope "the little stranger" keeps well, and I hope he'll turn out to be a boy. I'm going to go for a yourney in the middle of August & shall come to see you about the 10th of September. Remember me to your wife & Aunt. I shall have lotts of things to talk about when I see you next.
Yours ever
L.W.
