Wednesday 
Dear Sraffa,
a) I believe it'll be better if I don’t come to you on Wednesdays. The reason may be simply that we haven’t got enough stuff, at present, which we can talk about successfully.
b) I should like, instead to drop in on you occasionally after Hall, risking that you mayn’t be in, or busy etc.
c) The disadvantage of this for me is that I shan’t see your mother, & I very much want to. I wonder if she’ld be kind enough to allow me to see her sometimes, say, at tea. Would you ask her?
d) If I don’t hear from you I’ll take it that this is all OK with you.
So long! 
Yours Ludwig Wittgenstein 
I’ll let you have Hardy’s book when I get it back, in a very few days.
