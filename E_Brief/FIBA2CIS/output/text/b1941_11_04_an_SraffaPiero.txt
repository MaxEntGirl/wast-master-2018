Dear Sraffa,
I have, so far, been very lucky here. The work is just what I wanted. I believe I am doing it quite well. I work from about 8.30 to about 4.30 or 5 & feel extremely tired when it’s over. The chap (20 years old) who’s in charge of me & shows me what to do I find an excellent teacher; we work well together & without any friction. My work, apart from carrying medicines & bandages etc around, consists in mixing ointments & the like. When the day’s work is done I have practically no strength left at all to think about anything. If my health will stick it & I get a little stronger bodily this may change. My quarters are with the doctors (address above), my room’s comfortable, but only moderately quiet. – Ryle is very nice to me. The other doctors I’ve seen so far seem stiff & unattractive. All the working people I met, I liked. 
The one serious & bad business is that I have bad nights. In spite (or perhaps because) of my great tiredness I sleep badly & that has an accumulative bad effect, & I have to take phanodorm, which I hate.
You once said I should write if I wanted you to send me anything. I’m now making use of this offer. Please go to Coulson, the chemist, & buy a tin of Sedin (if possible a large one) for me (it’s 6/6). He probably has reserved one for me so please tell him it’s for me. I’ll settle with you when I come to Cambridge.
Give your mother all my very best wishes. If I come to Cambridge in the weekend after next I’ll try to see you.
Ludwig Wittgenstein
