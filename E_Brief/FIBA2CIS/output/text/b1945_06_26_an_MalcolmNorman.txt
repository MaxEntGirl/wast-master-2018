Dear Norman,
It was good to get your letter of June 21st. I want to say something about the war being a "boredom". If a boy said that school was an intensive boredom one might answer him that, if he only could get himself to learn what can really be lerned there, he would not find it so boring. Now forgive me for saying that I can't help believing that an enormous lot can be learnt about human beings in this war ‒ if you can keep your eyes open. And the better you are at thinking the more you'll get out of what you see. For thinking is digesting. If I'm writing in a preaching tone I'm just an ass! but the fact remains that if you're bored a lot it means that youre mental digestion isn't what it should be.
I think a good remedy for this is sometimes opening your eyes wider. Sometimes a book helps a little, e.g. T.'s "Hadshi Murat" wouldn't be bad. If you can't get it in America let me know. I might be able to get it here. I've tried the various booksellers in Cambridge, but they haven't got it & say they can't get it. Smythies said one might get it at the Oxford University Press.
My work is going damn slowly. I wish I could get a volume ready for publishing by next autumn; but I probably shan't. I'm a bloody bad worker!
I'm looking forward to the magazines! It was very nice of you to send them.
There's another fair in Cambridge now, much bigger than the one we went to. I rolled a few pennies but didn't win a thing! I need you.
Smythies was glad to see you. He sends his good wishes. ‒ So do I! Look after yourself, body & soul, & be good all round!
So long!
Affectionately
Ludwig Wittgenstein
