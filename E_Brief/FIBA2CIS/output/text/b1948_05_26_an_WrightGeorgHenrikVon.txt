Dear von Wright
Thank you for two letters. I'm glad that you've accepted. May things go well!! â€’ My life here is very strenuous as I'm living completely alone. The cottage is on the West coast of Ireland, right on the sea. I arrived here a month ago & don't yet know how things will shape as time goes on. At present I get tired, bodily & mentally, very easily. That's bad, but perhaps it'll mend.
Perhaps we shall see each other before too long!
Lots of good wishes!
Ludwig Wittgenstein
