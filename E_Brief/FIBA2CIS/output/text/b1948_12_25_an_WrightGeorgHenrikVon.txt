Text: 
Holly wreaths
are cheery
Twinkling candles
glow
May they shed much
Happiness
And deepest Joys
bestow
The light of its cheery candles.
The gifts of its joy for mirth.
Is asked for you this christmas.
The sweetest old day on earth.
With all GOOD WISHES
for a
HAPPY CHRISTMAS and a
PROSPEROUS NEW YEAR
To v. Wright
from
Ludwig Wittgenstein
