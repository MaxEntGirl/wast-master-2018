Dear Saunders, 
Thank you very much for your letter, dated April 24th, which I received just before my operation. I am very grateful to the General Board for their generous decision. I am well on the way to recover & expect to be able to take up my work at the hospital again in 5 or 6 weeks.
 Please forgive my not writing sooner.
 Yours sincerely, 
L. Wittgenstein
