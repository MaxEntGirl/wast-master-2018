Dear Mr Saunders,
I have received your letter dated May 20th. As I feared, there has been a misunderstanding. There was never a question of applying for a permit allowing me “to remain in this country” (as you write), but allowing me to accept a University appointment in this country. If, therefore you have asked the General Board the first question, their answer cannot be relevant to my case.
I do not wish however to cause the Board any further trouble, & I shall therefore apply to the Home Office myself if it should be necessary, which I now have reason to think won’t be the case.
Yours truly 
L. Wittgenstein
