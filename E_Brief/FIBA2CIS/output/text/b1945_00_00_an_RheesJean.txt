Text: 
Dear Mrs Rhees,
The Florist tells me that the Hydrangea should be watered every day by immersion of the whole pot into a bucket of water for about 10 minutes. That seems rather a long time, but it is what he said.
Thanks for everything. Don't let the double d..... cat eat all the flowers.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
