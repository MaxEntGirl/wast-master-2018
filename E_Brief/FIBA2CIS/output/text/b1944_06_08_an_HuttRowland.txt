Dear Roland,
Thank you for your letter & the detective mags. I wish you luck & patience! & no more dealings with psychologists.
Drury, I think, has left England for the 2nd front. May he have luck too!
My work hasn't been going too well, which makes my future rather doubtful. I don't intend to come to Cambridge or London in the next 2 months, but I may have to.
If I am near you I'll let you know.
Good wishes!
Ludwig
