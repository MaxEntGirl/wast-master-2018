Text: 
Thursday
Dear Moore,
The Thomsons want you & me to come to them tomorrow at teatime. (They live: Lavender Cottage, Storey's Way off Huntingdon Rd.) Now I don't feel very well, I may have a slight 'flue or something, so I probably shan't be able to come. But they should like to see you without me, & possibly you might play some piano-duetts with Mrs Thomson. So would you go there say at 4.15 or if you can't, write them a note?
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
I wish I could be there & hear you play!
