Dear Mrs Rhees,
Thanks very much for your card. I'm afraid I don't know the Dolomites. (Though I'd probably not be moved if I saw them.) ‒ I wonder if you could put me up Friday next, Sept. 29th, until either Sunday or Monday. Con Drury is coming to London on Friday & staying 2 or 3 days on his way from Exeter to Dublin. If it's inconvenient for you, I am sure I'll be able to find a room elsewhere. Ben Richards has his written exam on Wednesday. He's worked hard & I hope to God he'll pass, but one can't be sure.
Please let me know, if possible by wire, whether you can put me up. I'd be very grateful, but that doesn't make it less of a nuisance for you.
I hope to see you soon any way. Yours sincerely
Ludwig Wittgenstein
