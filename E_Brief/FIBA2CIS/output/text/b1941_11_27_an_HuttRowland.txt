Dear Roland,
Thanks for your letter, dated 8th Nov. & another one some weeks ago. I can't write about Francis, & what you write about him, though in a sense true, somehow doesn't click with my thoughts of him. ‒ I don't know if I've written to you that I've left Cambridge & taken up a manual job at Guy's Hospital in London. I'm doing work in & around the dispensary of the Hospital. I had planned to do this before Francis fell ill. I haven't actually resigned my professorship but only taken "leave of absense" without pay. Here I earn about 28s per week. The work, which is pretty hard, is all right for me. I hope my body'll be able to stick it. ‒ I'm sorry you're depressed. My soul is very tired, & it isn't at all in a good state, I mean, not at all as it should be. ‒ Perhaps, when we shall see each other again it will help us in some way.
Give my wishes to Lotte!
As always ‒
Ludwig
