My dear Keynes,
Thanks so much for your letter! I am still teacher & don't want any money at present. I have decided to remain teacher, as long as I feel that the troubles into which I get that way, may do me any good. If one has toothache it is good to put a hot water bottle on your face, but it will only be effective, as long as the heat of the bottle gives you some pain. I will chuck the bottle when I find that it no longer gives me the particular kind of pain which will do my character any good. That is, if people here dont turn me out before that time. If I leave off teaching I will probably come to England and look for a job there, because I am convinced that I cannot find anything at all possible in this country. In this case I will want your help.
Please remember me to your wife.
Yours ever
Ludwig
Give my love to Johnson if you see him.
