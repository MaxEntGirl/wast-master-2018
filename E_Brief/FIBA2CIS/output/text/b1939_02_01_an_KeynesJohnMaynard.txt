Dear Keynes,
I went round to King's College last night with the M.S. but was told that you had gone to London; so I took it back again & shall keep it till Friday unless you want it before then. I want to use the two days to look a little through the translation & perhaps correct some of the worst mistakes. I havent yet had time to do this (queer as this may sound). My translator did about half of the first volume & then had to leave for America where his father died some weeks ago. I'll also give you the German text â€’ in case it's any use to you. Not that I think that it's worth your while looking at it, or at the translation; but as you wish to see it of course you'll get it. (Moore has read most of the German text & might possibly be able to give some information about it.) I'm afraid there's only one copy of the English in existence & only one corrected copy of the German; you'll get these two copies.
Thanks ever so much for taking all this trouble (in what I believe to be a lost cause).
Yours ever
Ludwig
