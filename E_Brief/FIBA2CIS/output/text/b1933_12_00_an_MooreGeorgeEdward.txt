Dear Moore,
This is the estimate. None of my lectures is over 1200 words & if we have them printed on foolscap they will each cost 4/6 that's to say 20 copies will cost that. Now I don't know exactly how many lectures there will be as possibly I might decide to dictate three times a week next term instead of only twice as I did this term. I dictated only 10 times this term so on the whole there will be about 52 lectures this academic year at the most, & these will cost between 11 & 12 pounds. If we only print 15 copies of each lecture, & there is no earthly reason why we should have more, they'll cost 10% less i.e. about Â£10.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
I wish you & Mrs Moore a happy Christmas & New Year.
