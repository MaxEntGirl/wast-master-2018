Dear v. Wright,
Thanks a lot for your letter. I'd love to stay with you & I hope I'll be able to. My plans are all very wobbly right now. After I had felt illish for about four months I had my blood examined a few days ago & it appears that I am very anaemic & there is likely to be some inner cause for that. I'm going to hospital today to have it investigated. So I wonder now if I shall really see you in June.
Good wishes!
Ludwig Wittgenstein
