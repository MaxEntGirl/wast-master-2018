Dear Dr Stewart,
I wanted to say good-bye to you to-day as I’m leaving Cambridge to-morrow. At the porters lodge they told me that you had been ill & in the nursing home. I was very sorry to hear it. I am going to London where I’ve accepted a manual job at Guy’s Hospital as what’s called “dispensary porter”. It may, of course, turn out that I’m too clumsy for it, in which case I’ll have to look for another job. 
I don’t know if you have heard that my friend Francis Skinner, whom you have met at your house, fell ill with poliomyelitis about a fortnight ago & died 3 days later. His death is not the cause of my leaving Cambridge, but but it makes my leaving more imperative.
I hope you will recover soon & I hope I shall see you again someday.
Yours sincerely
Ludwig Wittgenstein
