Dear Norman,
Thank you for your letter & the 2 pictures. Both of them are very good. ‒ Yesterday a Mr Gilpatrick from the Rockefeller Foundation visited me. I told him what I wrote to you some months ago, i.e., that in my present state of health & intellectual dullness I couldn't accept a grant; but I said that if, against all probability & hope, I should one day find that I could again do worthwhile work in philosophy, I'd write to him. And so we parted on friendly terms. ‒ The Bouwsmas are enormously kind to me. I am ever so glad that he can have discussions with Smythies & Miss A.. Otherwise this place is a philosophical desert; & I am just good enough to eat applesauce with a philosopher. My mind's completely dead. This isn't a complaint, for I don't really suffer from it. I know that life must have an end once & that mental life can cease before the rest does. ‒ Your pull-over is wonderful & fits me perfectly.
Give my love to Lee, & Good Luck to Ray.
Thanks for all your kindness.
Affectionately
Ludwig
From Bouwsma & Gilpatrick I heard that you gave a good paper at Toronto.
