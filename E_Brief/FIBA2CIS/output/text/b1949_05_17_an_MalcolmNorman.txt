My dear Norman,
Please forgive me for not writing sooner. I received your affidavid etc. about 3 weeks ago in Vienna. I went to Vienna in the middle of April to see my eldest sister who is very ill. When I left 5 days ago she was still alive but there is no hope of her recovering. I arrived here last night. While I was in Vienna I was hardly able to write at all. I felt so rotten myself. I haven't done any work since the beginning of March & I haven't had the strength of even trying to do any. God knows how things will go on now. â€’ I shall go to the American Consulate here with your affidavid etc. & I'm sure it'll be all he wants if he isn't mad. As I think I've written to you, I have a ticket for the Queen Mary, sailing July 21st. I hope all of you are well, & I hope you won't find me a terribly disagreable companion & bore when I come. All good wishes to all of you!
Affectionately
Ludwig
