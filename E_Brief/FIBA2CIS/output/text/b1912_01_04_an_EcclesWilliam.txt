Dear E.,
Thanks for your letter. I have thought about your question & hope you will be able to read the answer: I think you ought to go to some first class German works before you go in for a job in England, how ever good & independent it may be. If however you can not get into first class German works there seams to me to be no point in going to Germany at all. My reason is that you have got a very good memory for Engineering matters & that I am sure you will be able to make use of any amount of experience if once you are allowed to do as you like. This is not all together a common place because most people (e.g. myself) can only make real use of a small amount of experience in their work because their experience is not so alive in them. I do not know if you understand what I mean & all that could much better be talked over. I am coming to Manchester about the 17th & hope sincerely to meet you there. My studies are going on very satisfactorily & I have lots to tell you about them.
L.W.
How is your bride?
