24.3.1919
Honoured, loved, gracious Lady,
Only the day before yesterday did I receive, to my great joy, your letter of the 24 Dec. 1918. Since the beginning of November I have been a prisoner of war. I am getting on all right. Ordinarily I can write postcards, this letter I am sending by an officer who is returning home. What I shall do when I get home I do not yet know myself. But at any rate I shall try to meet my friends again as soon as it is possible. My book will be published as soon as I get home. It is true that the meeting to which I most looked forward during these five years has not been allowed to me. Nearly every day I think of dear David. May things go well with you always. With heartiest greetings to you from your truly grateful
L. W. 
My address is Cassino, Italia, Campo concentramento, Prigionieri Guerra, Reparto Ufficiali.
