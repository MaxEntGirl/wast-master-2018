Dear Moore,
Thanks so much for your letter. I'm sorry I caused you horrid troubles. I didn't really expect such a long account of the meeting. But all you wrote to me interested me enormously because I think I know exactly what Johnson was at. It ‒ of course ‒ all turns on the question as to the nature of deduction. And ‒ I think ‒ the clue to it all lies in the fact that  only then expresses the deductive relation when this prop is the generalization of a tautology.
You must come as soon as Term ends and I shall meet you in Bergen. I am looking forward to your coming more than I can say! I am bothered to death with Logik & other things. But I hope I shan't dy before you come for in that case we couldn't discuss much.
Yours etc.
L.W.
P.S. Boats run from Newcastle to Bergen 3 times a week. I shall expect you in Bergen about the 20th of March. What has happened with young Sedgwick whome Hardy [tried] to run? Has he become a member of the Society?
