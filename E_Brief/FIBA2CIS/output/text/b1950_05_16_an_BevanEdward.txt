Dear Doctor,
Thanks a lot for the phenobarb & amytal. I’m glad you didn’t ienclose supol & my recorlish co, as I’ve got tons of both. (Figuratively speaking.)
If I had anything to say, or had any pull with the church authorities I’d have you canonised.
I sent Prof. Pancet’s letter to Con. I thought he’d be interested & you wouldn’t mind. The other expert did well to remain anonymous.
from
Ludwig Wittgenstein B.M.
