Dear Ogden,
I have now got another post as school teacher. My address is:
Hasbach bei Neunkirchen
Nieder Österreich
I am very anxious to know how the book is going on. I hope no further difficulties have turned up during the printing.
Could you get Mrs Pinsents address? Please let me know it, and all about the book too. ‒ This place is rather nice as far as nature goes but the people are as hideous as in Trattenbach.
Please remember me to Keynes if you see him and tell him he might right me a line if he isn't too busy.
Yours very sincerely
Ludwig Wittgenstein
