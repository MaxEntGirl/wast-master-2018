Sunday
Dear Rowland,
It goes without saying that for us to meet in the evening on weekdays isn't anything like as good, both for me & for yourself, as meeting on a Sunday would be, when I'd be more rested & unhurried. If, however, you can't arrange to see me on a Sunday a week-day will have to do. In this case to come even half an hour too late would be unwise; for, under the circs, it's quite easy for us to make a mess of things, but ever so undesirable!
Good wishes!
Ludwig
