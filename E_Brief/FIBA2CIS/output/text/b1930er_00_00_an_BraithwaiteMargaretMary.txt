Dear Miss Master[m]an,
Thanks for your note. I wondered why you weren’t turning up. – I needn’t say that I understand the reason perfectly & that I’m not angry. What I hope is that, whatever you do instead of coming to my classes, you will do with as much seriousness, decency & honesty as I think you had when you tried to do Philosophy.
should very much like to see you again before very long.
Yours sincerely
Ludwig Wittgenstein
