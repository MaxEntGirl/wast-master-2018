Dear Wittgenstein
I returned yesterday from Russia (where there are no posts) & found your letter waiting for me. I don't care twopence about the introduction but I shall be really sorry if your book isn't printed. May I try, in that case, to have it printed in England or America?
I have 2 months' letters to answer so I mustn't write more. Best love, now & always.
yrs all
B. R.
