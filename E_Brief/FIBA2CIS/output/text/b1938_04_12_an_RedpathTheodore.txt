Dear Redpath,
Our letter did wonders. ‒ I had a letter from Keynes on Saturday morning saying that he had written a letter to Mr Gwatkin the solicitor. I saw Mr G. yesterday & he seems very kind & helpful. I did not, as I said I would, ring up an other solicitor on Friday but took the chance & waited for Keynes to keep his promise, & I'm glad I did.
Thank you very much indeed for your help which has proved most valuable.
So long!
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
