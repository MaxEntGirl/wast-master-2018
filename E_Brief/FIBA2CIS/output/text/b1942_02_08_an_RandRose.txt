Dear Dr. Rand,
Thank you for your Easter card & the chocolate bar – though I wish you hadn’t sent that. – I have not yet been able either to phone to, or see, Miss Hermes or Miss Tait. I may be able to do it at the end of next week or the beginning of the one after. I shall then let you know the result. Good wishes!
Yours sincerely,
 Ludwig Wittgenstein
