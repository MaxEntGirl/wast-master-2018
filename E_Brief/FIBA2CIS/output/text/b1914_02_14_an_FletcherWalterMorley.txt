Dear Dr Fletcher,
A few daies ago I received the enclosed note & I think it must have been sent to me by mistake as Mr Russell has paied my College bill some daies before the note was made out. I hope the mater shall be settled when you get this. If not, would you kindly let me know.
Yours sincerely
Ludwig Wittgenstein
