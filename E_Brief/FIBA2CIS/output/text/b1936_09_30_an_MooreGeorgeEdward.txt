Dear Moore,
I'm in Skjolden again and living in the little house I built for myself before the war. When I came here I was very ill but thank God I've recovered now though I'm still rather weak. My work doesn't go badly considering. I'm very much alone and very undisturbed. I think it may have been the right thing to come here. The country round me is wonderful and just now we've got fine weather. I haven't forgotten about the photos I promised to send you and Mrs. Moore but I haven't got them yet. Please remember me to Mrs. Moore and to Wisdom. I shall write to him soon.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
My house is not on the pc. It's about half an hour to row and walk from the village.
