Tuesday
Dear Moore,
This is a P.S. to my last letter. I met Mr Butler in the street today & he asked me 1.) whether you knew all about my financial position (I said, you did) 2.) Whether I had no other sources of getting money (I said, no) 3.) Whether I had not got relations who could help me (I said, I had & had told you so) Now as it somehow appears as if I tried to conceal something, will you please accept my written declaration that: not only I have a number of wealthy relations, but also that they would give me money if I asked them to. But that I will not ask them for a penny. (unless ‒ of course ‒ they owed me money) Also I will add, that this is not a mere caprice of myne.
Yours ever
Ludwig Wittgenstein
