Tuesday 
Dear Bevan,
Thanks for your letter & for the prescription. I have everything I need. In about a fortnight, or 3 weeks I’ll pester you again for some yellow tablets & some iron, but not now. – I hope the weather in Cambridge isn’t what it’s here: cold & at the same time oppressive, a combination which I’ve never experienced before. I wish I had anything  intelligent to write to you, but there isn’t a thought in my bl.. head. –
Thanks for everything.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
