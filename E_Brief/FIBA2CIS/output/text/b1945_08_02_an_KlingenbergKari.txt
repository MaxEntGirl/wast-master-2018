Dear Kari,
I have to write to you in English because my Norwegian is so bad that I am afraid you might not be able to understand it. Thanks ever so much for writing to me. I longed to hear from you & all my friends in Skjolden. I wished you had written a little more about how everybody is. You didn't mention Arne Draegni & Arne Bolstad, or Fr√∏ken Rebni. Please
