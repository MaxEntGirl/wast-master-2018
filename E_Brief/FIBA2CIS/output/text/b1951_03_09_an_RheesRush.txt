Dear Rhees,
Thanks for your letter. I moved to Cambridge about a month ago because Dr Bevan (with whom I'm staying) advised me to get some deep x-ray treatment at Addenbrookes. I have now much less pain than I had during the really bad time at Oxford. This isn't all due to the treatment though, for the pain had already decreased before I came here, & if it hadn't I couldn't have travelled. The doctor who supervises the treatment, Prof. Mitchell, is a cancer speciallist with a lot of experience & also intelligence ("an excellent thing in doctors"). I'm up every day a bit & often the whole day. I'm very weak physically & mentally & have all sorts of discomforts but very little pain. ‒ I should very much like to see you around April 8th. I don't know yet where I shall be then. Whether here or in Oxford. We can arrange details of place & time later. ‒ The weather here is terrible: cold, windy & weat. I see very little of it because I'm in doors the whole time except when I go to the hospital by taxi. A fortnight ago, when I felt particularly well for a bit, I walked from Addenbrookes to Great St. Mary's. Perhaps when you come I'll have another good spell. ‒ I read a good deal & not only detective stories.
I'm looking forward to seeing you. This letter is damn stupid, but what will you ‒
I hope you'll have some good weather for walks & altogether some good luck in various respects.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
