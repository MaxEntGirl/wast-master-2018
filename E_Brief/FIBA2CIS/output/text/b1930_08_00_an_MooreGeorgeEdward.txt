Text: 
Dear Moore,
Thanks for your letter. I'm sorry you have such trouble at home. These illnesses are a bl. nuisance. â€’ My work is getting on moderately well but not more than that, I hardly ever feel quite alive. The weather is tolerable though rather changeable. Desmond Lee, whom you know, came to Austria & stayd with my people near where I live for a few days. We talked about you & wondered whether you'ld like the place. And I almost think you would. I'm going to stay here as long as possible to get something done.
Yours ever
L Wittgenstein
