Dear Keynes,
Got your letter you wrote January 10th today. I'm very interested to hear that Russell has published a book lately. Could you possibly send it to me & let me pay you after the war? I'ld so much like to see it. By the way, you're quite wrong if you think that being a soldier prevents me from thinking about propositions. As a mater of fact I've done a good deal of logical work lately, & hope to do a good deal more soon. ‒ Please give my love to Johnson. The war hasn't altered my private feelings in the least (thank God!!) or rather: I think I've grown a little milder. I wonder if Russell has been able to make anything out from the notes I gave to Moore last Easter?
Yours
L. Wittgenstein
