18 September 1935
Dear Moore,
I shall come back to Cambridge in about two weeks. I will try to get something ready for publication. Whether successfully, God knows. I intend to stop in Cambridge for the whole academic year and to lecture. If you think it wise, please have my lectures announced.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
