Dear Rhees,
There is going to be a discussion in Taylor's room (Newmarket Street) tomorrow (Saturday) at 5 p. m.. I'm writing you this not because I'm expecting you to come, but just on the off-chance that you might like to come, although it certainly won't be worth coming to. Thanks for your letter. (By the way, please waive the "Dr" writing to me!) In case you come, please have supper with me & Skinner.
So long!
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
I hear from Lewy that the congress here is by far worse than the one at Oxford!
