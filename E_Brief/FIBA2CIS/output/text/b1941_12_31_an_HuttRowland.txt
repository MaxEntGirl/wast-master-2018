Dear Roland
Thanks a lot for the cocoa & the surrounding Christmas card. It was nice to get it! I feel, on the whole, lonely & am afraid of the months & years to come! It's a nasty thought. May I have more decent & more cheerful thoughts again one day!
I hope that you have some happiness & that you appreciate whatever you have of it more than I did.
As always
Ludwig
