My dear Roland,
Thanks for your letter, dated Dec 16th, & the nice Christmas card. I was very sorry to hear that you are (or were?) in a hospital. I hope you are better now or well!
I was also sorry to hear about Lotte having trouble with Peter.
I sent you a Christmas card & two small parcels to your old address to which I will also send this letter. They'll arrive very late because I only posted them yesterday. The explanation is, I'm extremely busy. When I finish work about 5 I'm so tired I often can hardly move & besides most of the shops are already closed by then.
I shall go to Cambridge today & have my Christmas dinner with the Barbrookes tomorrow.
Good wishes!
As always
Ludwig
