Dear Roy,
I'm writing this rather in a hurry. It's only to tell you that I'm thinking of you & hoping that you'll soon come back. I'm sorry the post is so unreliable. I'm going to give you a little X-mas present, but I'd rather not send anything now, so for the moment this card will have to do. ‒ I haven't been too well lately, though not overworked. I've had a good deal of worries. ‒ It's d... bad luck that you lost your kit-bag. Come home so you don't need it anymore!
Look after yourself!
God bless you.
As always
Ludwig
WARMEST WISHES FOR A VERY HAPPY
CHRISTMAS, AND A NEW YEAR
PLENTEOUS IN THE BLESSINGS OF
HEALTH, HAPPINESS AND PEACE
To Roy
From
Ludwig
