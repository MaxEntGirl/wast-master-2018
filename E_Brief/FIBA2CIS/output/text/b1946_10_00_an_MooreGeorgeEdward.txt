Dear Moore,
I was sorry I was not allowed to see you today. Mrs Moore wrote to me, could I come next Tuesday, instead. Now I'm free on Tuesday afternoon &, as you know, should like to see you, not for any particular reason, but in an ordinary friendly way. But I am sure you'll understand that, ‒ under the peculiar circumstances, ‒ I should like to know whether what Mrs Moore wrote to me was an honest to God invitation for me to come & see you on Tuesday, or whether it was a kind of hint that I'ld better not try to see you. If it was the latter, please don't hesitate to say so. I will not be hurt in the slightest, for I know that queer things happen in this world. It's one of the few things I've really learnt in my life. So please, if that's how it is, just write on a p.c. something like "Don't come". I enclose a card in case you haven't got one. I'll understand everything. Good luck & good wishes!
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
