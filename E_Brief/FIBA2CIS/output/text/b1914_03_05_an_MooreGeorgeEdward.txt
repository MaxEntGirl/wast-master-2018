Dear Moore,
Only a few lines because I'm just now in the right moode. First of all: write soon when exactly you're going to come to Bergen. Secondly: come soon. Thirdly: I've got out lots of new logical stuff. (I don't dare to say more). Fourthly: If you see Johnson please give him my kindest regards. Fifthly: if you see Muscio please tell him that he's a beast (he'll know why). Sixthly: once more â€’ come soon. That's all.
Yours etc. etc.
L.W.
