Dear Moore
I was glad to get your letter. My work isn't going badly. I don't know if I wrote to you that when I came here I began to translate into & rewrite in German the stuff I had dictated to Skinner & Miss Ambrose. When about a fortnight ago, I read through what I had done so far I found it all, or nearly all, boring & artificial. For having the english version before me had cramped my thinking. I therefore decided to start all over again & not to let my thoughts be guided by anything but themselves. ‒ I found it difficult the first day or two but then it became easy. And so I'm writing now a new version & I hope I'm not wrong in saying that it's somewhat better than the last. ‒ Besides this all sorts of things have been happening inside me (I mean in my mind). I won't write about them now, but when I come to Cambridge, as I intend to do for a few days about New Year, I hope to God I shall be able to talk to you about them; & I shall then want your advice & your help in some very difficult & serious matters. ‒
I was very glad to hear that Skinner came to the Mor. Sc. Club & that he spoke. I wish it were possible for you to see him once in a while! It would do him masses of good. For he needs someone he can talk to decently & seriously!
If ever you see Ryle or write to him give him my love. I can quite imagine that he didn't read a good paper & also that he was nice & decent & agreeable in the discussion.
I intend to leave here for Vienna about Dec. 8th & to come to Cambridge about the 30th Dec. & to stay about a week.
Best wishes!
Ludwig Wittgenstein
