Text: 
I
Dear old Blood (if I may this ....), Thanks so much for your letter. (Again, you know that I mean it.) These cards will show you the characteristics of
II
Barock. I find that I cann't come to London on the 9th as a Nephew of mine gets married that day & I've got to
III
to be present at the ceremony. (Not of course that I can do anything essential for their future
IV
happiness.)
I shall therefore leave Vienna on the 10th & get to London on the 11th. Which I'm afraid
V
is a Monday.
But still we can go to a cinema after your business hours, I hope.
VI.
I'll let you know the exact hour of my arrival later to give you the opportunity
VII
to meet me with due respect etc etc. The gold which I wind round these cards is symbolic
VIII.
of the gold of my heart & yours.
Yours in bloodyness
Ludwig
