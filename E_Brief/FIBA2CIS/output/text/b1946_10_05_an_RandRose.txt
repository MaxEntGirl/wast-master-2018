Dear Miss Rand,
Thanks for your letter of Sept. 29th. I am quite certain that I shall be unable to give you advice which will be of any use to you. It is, therefore, a waste of time if you come to see me. After I had received your letter I went to see someone at the 'Society for the Protect. of Science & Learning' to ask whether they had heard from you. I was told that you were trying ||again|| to get some sort of academic job. I must tell you quite bluntly that I have not changed my mind about your qualification for such a job, or about the likelihood of your getting one. I am unable to recommend you for an academic post myself, & I can’t advise you to try for such a post as I do not think that you have a chance.
The only advice I can give you is to do work in which you can make use of your manual skill & not to think that it’s shameful to do w decent work with your hands.
As this is all that I can say, please stop asking me for my opinion & advice.
May a ray of real intelligence enlighten you!
Yours sincerely 
L. Wittgenstein
