Text: 
Dear Moore,
Many thanks for your letter. I am glad that you will have regular discussions with me when you come up and I can't see for my life why you shouldn't be able to! That Johnson at last gives a paper to the Club interests me enormously! What was it like?? And what was it really about? To say the truth I don't like the title. However â€’ Identity still plays hell with me. We had already heavy snowfalls but it isn't cold. Write soon and a lot about Johnson's paper.
Yours etc
Ludwig Wittgenstein
Is Muscio still alive? And, if so, what's he doing?
