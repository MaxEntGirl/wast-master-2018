Dear Roland,
Thanks a lot for the jam. It's excellent. Only you ought to have keapt it for yourself.
I hope you'll soon be out of the army & that you'll get a good & suitable job. May you have lots of luck! I really mean strength to bear whatever comes. ‒ I intend to stay here until the end of the month or the beginning of October. I hope I shall be able to stay with you when you'll have a home.
I'm doing some work here but not much. I don't feel well; partly because I'm having trouble with one of my kidneys, partly because whatever I read of the triumphant beastliness of the Allies in Germany & Japan makes me feel sick, partly because I am no better than I am.
Thanks again! And thank Lotte, too, in my name. I'm sure she was the chief agent & you only an accessory before & after the fact.
Good wishes! So long!
Ludwig
If you see Goodstein, please give him my best wishes.
