Dear v. Wright,
This is just to ask you a favour. As you may remember I gave you ration cards for two weeks (they are marked in ink "5" & "6"). Now I want you to take all the rations obtainable by these cards & then to send me what remains of the cards, i.e., just the bit of paper that remains when all coupons are cut away. I need these bits for a purpose which it would be too long to explain in a letter. Of course it's possible that these bits may already have been thrown away, in which case there is nothing one can do about it, & it's no tragedy. â€’ I want to thank you & your wife again for all the great kindness you've shown me. My health is sofar unchanged, not particularly good. I don't know as yet how things will go here & won't know for some days.
Give my kind regards to all your family.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
