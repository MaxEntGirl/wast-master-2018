Dear Dr Fletcher,
I am afraid I shall not be able to come to Cambridge at the begining of term as my father is very seriously ill. Although it is certain that he will not recover, one can not yet tell whether the illness will take a very rapid course or not. I will therefore have to stay here another ten days & hope I shall then be able to decide whether I may go back to Cambridge or must stay in Vienna, until the end. If I cannot leave here in ten days I will let you know.
Yours sincerely
Ludwig Wittgenstein
