Dear Sraffa, 
I may have to leave here in two or three days & arrive in London on the 7th in order to catch the Aquitania leaving Southampton on the 8th for New York. In this case I shan’t have time to come to Cambridge to fetch money for paying my fare & I’m afraid I must ask you to send me sixty pounds (in some form, cheque or otherwise) to some London address. I suppose the best thing will be to send it poste restante & wire me where I shall find it. It’s not yet clear whether I shall have to go to New York but the money must be ready, in case. 
I am quite well. I shall wire you if I have to go & possibly I could come to Cambridge for a few hours or we might meet in London if its o.k. with you.
Lots of good wishes. Please remember me to your mother.
Yours 
Ludwig Wittgenstein
