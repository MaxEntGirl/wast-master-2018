My dear Watson,
It is ages since you heard from me last. I’m sending you the lecture notes which were taken from the lectures I gave two years ago (i.e. in the academic year 33–34). Don’t read them please unless you’ve really nothing better to do! Should you read them and get a little pleasure out of them I’d be very glad. I have not yet published anything and don’t know if I ever will but my intention is now to have something publishable ready by the end of this academic year. After that I want to leave Cambridge and Philosophy and I have some mad plans. One is to study medicine, if I still have the brains to study anything. I long for a job which brings me in closer contact with human beings.
Drury, whom I think you know, is in Dublin studying medicine. He is getting on very well indeed. I’m only afraid that he works too much and eats too little. I’m fairly healthy though growing more and more stupid steadily. There is no drug to stop that. Prof. Moore is well too and hasn’t changed a bit (as far as I can notice.)
I hope you’ll let me hear from you before long.
Best wishes! Yours ever
Ludwig Wittgenstein
I hope your family is well!
