Dear Roland,
Thank you for your letter. Some days ago I had two big parcels with food from Ffennell. I shall not use them for myself because I've got plenty to eat. I know that you & Goodstein could use some more food & I am going to send you some of the stuff unless Ffennell has sent you a parcel, too. Please let me know straight away, as I don't want to have the food lying about in my rooms. Let me know about Goodstein, too. I don't want to write to him about it myself.
Good wishes!
Ludwig
