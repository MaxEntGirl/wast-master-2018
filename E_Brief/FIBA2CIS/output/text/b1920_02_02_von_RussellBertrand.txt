Herr Ludwig Wittgenstein,
Wien, XIII St. Veitgasse 17.
Dear Wittgenstein,
I have broken my collar-bone and am therefore obliged to dictate this letter.
I am very glad to hear that Reklam will probably take your book. I waited to begin writing the introduction until I knew you had a publisher, since the introduction would have had to be quite different if it had been written for publication in England. I will get it done as soon as I possibly can, but I do not think it can be finished for another six weeks. You may, however, absolutely count upon it, and tell your publishers so.
I am very sorry to hear you have been ill.
I do not go back to Cambridge until October.
Keynes, as you may have heard, has written a book of the very greatest importance on the economic consequences of the peace. It is having a great effect upon opinion here, and is likely to do much good.
I loved our time together at the Hague, and was very happy, both in seeing you and in our discussions.
Yours ever,
Bertrand Russell
