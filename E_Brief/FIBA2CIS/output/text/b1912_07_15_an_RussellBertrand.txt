Dear Russell,
The above address & this perfectly earthly writing paper will show you that I am not in hell. In fact I am quite well again & philosophizing for all I am worth. What troubles me most at present, is not the apparent-variable-business, but rather the meaning of "∨", ".", "⊃" etc. This latter problem is ‒ I think ‒ still more fundamental &, if possible, still less recognized as a problem. If "p ∨ q" means a complex at all ‒ which is quite doubtfull ‒ then, as far as I can see, one must treat "∨" as part of a copula, in the way we have talked over before. I have ‒ I believe ‒ tried all possible ways of solution under that hypothesis & found that if any one will do it must be something like this: Let us write the prop. "from ⊢ p & ⊢ q follows ⊢ r" that way: "i[p; q; r]. Here "i" is a copula (we may call it inference) which copulates complexes. Then "" is to mean:
"



 ".
If "p ∨ q" does not mean a complex, then heaven knows what it means!! ‒ Now I would like to know how you are & all about you! If you are so good to write to me, please write to the following address:
L. W. junior (please don't forget this)
bei Paul Wittgenstein
Oberalm bei Hallein Salzburg
Austria
We have excellent weather here, such that one can do most thinking in the open air. There is nothing more wonderfull in the world than the true problems of Philosophy!
Allways yours
most etc.
Ludwig Wittgenstein
