Dear Norman,
Thanks a lot for your letter of March 24th. I have booked a passage to New York on the Queen Mary for July 21st, & if my health & other circumstances permit it I will come & be a d.... nuisance to you & Lee for 2 or 3 months. May everything go well. ‒ I can't use your letter as an affidavid; its a much more formal affair than you imagine. I enclose a cutting from the regulations & a form of affidavid. I know that all this red tape is hellish but we can't change it; so please read the damn thing through carefully & comply with all the requirements. There is one more thing I want to say: In this life one doesn't know what's going to happen; & so, supposing later on you were inclined, for whatever reason, to change your mind about the desirability of my visit, please don't hesitate to tell me so. I'm told that I can have all my money for the ticket refunded (except 10 s, which is nothing). ‒ I haven't been doing any work at all for the last 2-3 weeks. My mind is tired & stale, partly, I think because I'm a bit exhausted, partly because lots of things worry me terribly just now. I think I could still discuss philosophy if I had someone here to discuss it with, but alone I can't concentrate on it. I suppose it'll all change some day. The sooner the better. ‒ Well then, please send me that affidavid & prepare yourself for the shock of seeing me. I'm looking forward to seeing you & Lee & Ray again. Give my love to Lee.
Affectionately
Ludwig
