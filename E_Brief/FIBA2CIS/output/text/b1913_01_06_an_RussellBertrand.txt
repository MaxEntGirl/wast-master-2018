Dear Russell,
I am very sorry not yet to have had a line from you!!! Not that there was anything in my last letter to you, that wanted answering; but you might have guessed that I feel von allen guten Geistern verlassen & that therefore I want a letter from you very necessarily. However â€’ I may not be able to come back to Cambridge at the begining of Term, as the illness of my poor father is growing very rapidly.
The Complex-Problem is getting clearer to me every day & I wish I could write clear enough to let you know what I think of it. Logic is a very good Invention.
Immer der Ihrige
Ludwig Wittgenstein
