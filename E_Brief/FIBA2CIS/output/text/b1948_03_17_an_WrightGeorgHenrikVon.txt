Dear v. Wright,
Thanks for your letter of March 3rd. About 2 weeks ago I sent the recommendation to the Registrary & a copy of it to Broad, just in case something should happen to the originals. I think I can say that, if you don't get the job, it's not because my recommendation wasn't warm enough; ‒ though I didn't say anything in it that I don't strictly believe to be the truth. ‒ My work is progressing very slowly & very painfully. I often believe that I am on the straight road to insanity: It is difficult for me to imagine that my brain should stand the strain very long. That I dread this end I needn't say. You're not the only one who needs more courage. May our fate not be too terrible! & may we be given courage.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
