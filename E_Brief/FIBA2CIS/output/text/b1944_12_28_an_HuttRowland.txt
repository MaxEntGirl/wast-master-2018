Dear Roland,
Thanks a lot for your nice present. I was very glad to get it. And it's very useful into the bargain.
I'm enjoying my stay here. I'm not staying with Rhees, but a very kindly, good-natured parson has put me up, & it's very peaceful here. I was glad to hear that you're working in the operating theater. Keep your eyes wide open. If you do you'll learn a lot of things, human & otherwise.
I wish you good things outside & inside!
Ludwig
