Monday
Dear Gilbert,
The weekend three weeks after the day you wrote, which I take to be Saturday 1st June etc., will suit me very well provided we can be together from Friday till Sunday. There's just one question: Should we spend these three days (or 2Â½ days) in Cambridge? If there is no better place it's allright; but I confess I should prefer it slightly to be somewhere else (N.B., Cambridge is a change for you but not for me). But I won't be dogmatic about this Point (Far be it...). Just think the matter over and let me know your decision. (Perhaps in a way I long to get away from here a little because I'm having all sorts of worry here at present.)
Yours with lots of blood
Ludwig
P.S.
By the way, This is my wife
