Wednesday
Dear Russell,
On Saturday the 13th I will read a paper to the Aristotelian Society in Nottingham & I would like to ask you if you could possibly manage to come there, as your presence would improve the discussion immensely & perhaps would be the only thing making it worth while at all. My paper (the one written for the meeting) is "Some remarks on logical form", but I intend to read something else to them about generality & infinity in mathematics which, I believe, will be greater fun*. ‒ I fear that whatever one says to them will either fall flatt or arouse irrelevant troubles in their minds & questions & therefore I would be much obliged to you if you came, in ordre ‒ as I said ‒ to make the discussion worth while.
Yours ever
L Wittgenstein
* though it may be all chinese to them.
