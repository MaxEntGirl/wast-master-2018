Dear Roy,
What's the matter with the post out there?! I'm writing to you regularly & you always complain that you don't get anything. I can only hope you'll get this letter & the heather I enclose. There is really hardly anything to write. I have been feeling pretty depressed of late, for a number of reasons. I'm working a moderate amount & going for walks quite a bit, which does me good. I have occasional letters from Austria, from my two sisters & from some friends. Everything there, & in the rest of Europe, is lousy. So when you'll come back you won't find anything marvelous. But I hope you'll come soon nevertheless. It'll save me a lot of trouble picking flowers & posting them to Sumatra!
Be good, look after yourself & don't linger longer in Sumatra!
God bless you!
Ludwig
