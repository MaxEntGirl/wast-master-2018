Dear Dr Rand,
I’m afraid I have forgotten when you first started coming to my classes. Was it at the beginning of Easter Term, or of Lent Term 1940? I want to know, as this ought to go into the certificate which you want me to give you. I can’t write much in such a certificate, & I don’t know if it will be of any use to you; but what I can write with a good conscience I will write.
Yours sincerely 
L. Wittgenstein
