Text: 
Dear old Beast, Thanks for your letter & the painting which I appreciate greatly. I would have known it to be a Pattisson immediately without looking at the signature. There is that bloodiness in it which has never before been expressed by the brush. Please let me know the result of your talk with Lady G.B. & also the result of your exam. If the latter isn't excellent, tell the examiners, that the greatest philosopher that ever lived pronounces them to be fools & see what impression that makes on them. Old god! g.b.y.!
Ludwig
