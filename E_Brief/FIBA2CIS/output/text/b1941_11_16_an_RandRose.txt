Dear Dr Rand,
Thanks for your note. I can’t do much to help you, but what I can do I do gladly. So come & ask me for help if you want any. If going to Letchworth is just now unfeasible I hope you’ll go & work in the factory. I’m sure you’ll do your work well. As to coming to my classes, make that application, but just continue coming, if you like, anyhow.
Good wishes! 
Yours sincerely 
L. Wittgenstein
