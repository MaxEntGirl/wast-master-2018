Dear Moore,
I had a note from Ewing today saying that I have been 'appointed a member of the Mor. Sc. faculty'. Could you tell me what exactly this means? Didn't I belong to the faculty before, & what has changed, now I do belong to it? Do I have new duties, or new rights? If you would let me have a line exp[l]aining this I should be grateful. Good wishes!
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
P.S.
I have seen the program of the Mor. Sc. Cl I think it's awful.
