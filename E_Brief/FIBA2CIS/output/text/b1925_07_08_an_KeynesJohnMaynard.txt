Text: 
Dear Keynes,
Some weeks ago I got a letter from a friend of mine in Manchester inviting me to stay with him some time during my holydays. Now I'm not yet quite desided about whether I shall come or not but I should rather like to, if I could also see you during my stay (about the middle of August). Now please let me know frankly if you have the slightest wish to see me. If you give me a negative answer I shan't mind in the least. Please write to me as soon as possible, as my holydays are rather short and I shall hardly have time enough to arrange for my journey.
Yours ever
Ludwig Wittgenstein
My address is: L. W. bei Dr HÃ¤nsel Wien V., Kriehubergasse 25
