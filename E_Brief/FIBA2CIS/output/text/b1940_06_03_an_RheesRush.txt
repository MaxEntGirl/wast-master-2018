Dear Rhees,
I very much want to hear from you. I imagine you must be extremely busy at present so I enclose a p. c.. I'ld like to know roughly how you are & whether there is any chance of my seeing you. ‒ I'm not feeling well these days: not really well bodily & rotten mentally. I feel this is rather shameful but don't know what to do about it. I'm still lecturing to about 8 people, but this week will probably be the last. I've also had so[me] 'at-homes' lately, not in spite of the war but because of the war. I thought it might steady people a little to have to think about some things strenously every now & again.
So long! Give my regards to Mrs Rhees.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
