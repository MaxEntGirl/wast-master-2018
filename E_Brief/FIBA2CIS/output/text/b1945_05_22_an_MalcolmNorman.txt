My dear Malcolm,
This morning I had your last letter from Brooklyn. Had I had it before I saw you it would have made getting into contact with you rather easier. I worked (dictated) till one o.c. & then remembered that I might still go to the station & see you off. I looked at a time-table & saw that there was a good train to London at exactly 1 o.c. & no good train after that for some time. So I concluded you were taking the 1 o.c. train & that I'ld be too late. Later Wisdom told me you had gone by a 1.50 train â€’ which I could still have caught. I was sorry I didn't try for that one. I should have liked to have told you about getting your letter & also to have repeated that I was glad to have seen you. I imagine there was a lot on your mind as well as on mine when you were with me. If you write to me, as I hope you will, you might call me by my Christian name & let me do the same. In case this should seem silly, or somehow wrong, to you, just say so frankly. I shan't be hurt.
Good luck! Affectionately
Ludwig Wittgenstein
