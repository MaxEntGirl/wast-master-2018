Dear Wittgenstein
I was very glad to get your letter the other day, with your nice message to the little boy, which, as you suggested, I conveyed by appropriate symbols other than words. He flourishes, & gives us both great happiness.
I wonder you haven't heard from Ostwald. Have you written to him to tell him your address? If not, I don't suppose he knows it. I have heard nothing further about publication of your book, either here or in Germany, but I will find out next time I see Ogden.
We intend to go to Germany & Switzerland next August. If you have holidays then, I hope we could see you then ‒ it would be easier for you, I suppose, than coming to England. In Switzerland we intend to stay with my brother's wife, who used to be Gräfin Arnim. I am sure she would be delighted to have you too, if you could come. I am very glad you will let me pay your expenses. If you can come to England sooner, do.
I liked China much better than Europe ‒ the people are more civilized ‒ I keep wishing I were back there. I lectured to them on all sorts of topics, but what they liked best was mathematical logic.
I wish you didn't have to work so hard at elementary teaching ‒ it must be very dreary. Would you like me to bring your journals & note-books when we next meet? Take care of yourself ‒ With love,
Yours ever
Bertrand Russell ‒
