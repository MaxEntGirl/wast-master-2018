Dear Mr Butler,
Thanks for your letter, dated October 24. I will not communicate with Prof. Pribram about the matter you mentioned & have explained my reasons for not doing so to Mr Priestley. He was so kind to promise me that he would explain them to you, in case you should want to know them, as I should find great difficulties in explaining them to you personaly.
Yours sincerely
L Wittgenstein
