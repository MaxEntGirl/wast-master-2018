Dear Moore,
I am still not at all well. I am bodily very weak & shaky, & feel incapable of thinking properly about my subject. I cannot therefore start lecturing now, & I don't know whether I shall regain sufficient strength in the next 3 weeks, say, to do so. What the cause of my condition is I don't know for certain, but I believe it is the recent 'flu & the great nervous strain of the last month or two. (My people in Vienna are in great trouble.)
I wonder whether it had not better be announced in the Reporter that I can't lecture for the present & until further notice.
Would you mind letting me know what you think best, or just do what you think best?
Good wishes.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
