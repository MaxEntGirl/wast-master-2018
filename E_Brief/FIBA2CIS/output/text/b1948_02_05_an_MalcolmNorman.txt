Dear Norman,
I had your letter of Jan. 6th a good long time ago. Thanks! I am now in very good bodily health & my work isn't going bad either. I have occasional queer states of nervous instability about which I'll only say that they're rotten while they last, & teach one to pray.
I've never read "The works of love". Kierkegaard is far too deep for me, anyhow. He bewilders me without working the good effects which he would in deeper souls. ‒ Years ago Drury read to Skinner & me the beginning of the "Conquest of Mexico" which we found very interesting indeed. That I didn't like the parsonish point of view of Prescott's is, of course, a different story. ‒ I am not reading much, [th]ank God. I read in Grimm's fairy tales & in Bismarck's 'Gedanken & Erinnerungen' which I admire greatly. I don't mean, of course, that my views are Bismarck's views. It's written in very excellent, though rather difficult German, as the sentences are very long. Otherwise I'd recommend you to look at it.
I wish you lots of good luck, & I know you wish me the same; & do I need it!
All the best to Lee & Ray.
Affectionately
Ludwig
I haven't anyone at all to talk to here, & this is good & in a way bad. It would be good to see someone occasionally to whom one could say a really friendly word. I don't need conversations. What I'd like would be someone to smile at occasionally.
