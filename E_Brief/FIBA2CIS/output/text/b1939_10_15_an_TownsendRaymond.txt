My dear Townsend,
Thanks for your letter, dated Oct. 3rd. I'm sorry you couldn't manage to see me. I feel pretty rotten in many ways, though less so now that I've moved into College. I have a very quiet room & a very nice bedmaker & that's a lot. I haven't been able to do decent work in my subject for a whole year; to be exact, since the crisis last year. This, I think, is due, partly at any rate, to the nauseating effect political events here & elsewhere have had on me, but it may also be due to age or what not. I seem to be washed up, as a researcher for good; & this is a serious business for me because I feel I'm no longer really qualified to hold my present past & because I'm oldish & don't know what else to do. Perhaps the war (if it should ever become a real war) may solve this problem for me. I should very much like to see you, as you know. So if you can bring this about, don't hesitate.
So long!
Yours affectionately
Ludwig Wittgenstein
