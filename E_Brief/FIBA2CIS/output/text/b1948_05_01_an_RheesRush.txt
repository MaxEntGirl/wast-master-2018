1.5.48.
Dear Rhees,
The above is my new address. I arrived here 3 days ago. The cottage is in the West, right on the sea shore. The scenery is rather wild & very beautiful. I'm feeling a bit better & have done a little work, very little & still rather futile, as my mind is very dull, & even a little thinking exhausts it completely. I hope this will get better. I have a lot of house-work to do, & that, on the whole, is good for me. A man comes here every day & brings me milk & helps a little about the house. ‒ My soul often feels very low, but sometimes I feel almost cheerful.
May you feel a little cheerful occasionally, too. This'll be all for today.
As always, Yours
L. Wittgenstein
