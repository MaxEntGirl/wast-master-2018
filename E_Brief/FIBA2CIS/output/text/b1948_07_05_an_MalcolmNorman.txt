Dear Norman,
I'm sure I have to thank both you & Lee for the marvelous parcel which arrived 3 days ago. I ought to have known that if I ask you to send anything (the Borden coffee) you'd send ten times more. It's all lovely & most useful, but let it be my Christmaspresent, please.
My work isn't going well though it's moving a bit. The other day I asked myself: ought I to have left the University, oughtn't I to have gone on teaching after all? I immediately felt that I couldn't possibly have continued teaching philosophy & even told myself that perhaps I ought to have resigned sooner; but then I thought of you & v. Wright in Cambridge & said to myself that I'd left exactly at the right moment. If my philosophical talent comes to an end now it's bad luck, but that's all.
I intend to stay here another 3-4 weeks & then to go to Dublin to see Drury for a few days, then to Oxford for a week or so, then I want to stay with Richards (whom you haven't met) near London & after that I want to go to Austria for [3-4 weeks] if I can get the permit. From Austria I'll return to this place, God being willing. ‒ Do you remember Shah, the Indian who came to my classes? He came to Leenane, a village 10 miles from here, & came to see me yesterday. I was glad to see him, although our talk wasn't particularly good (I'm often tired & irritable now, I'm sorry to say). He is leaving for India in August or September. He'd rather stay in Europe, I believe, but perhaps it'll be good for him to get out of this civilisation for a bit. But how should I know! ‒ Shah told me that Kreisel may go to Princ[e]ton next year.
Thanks again & all good wishes to you & Lee! & Raymond.
Affectionately
Ludwig
