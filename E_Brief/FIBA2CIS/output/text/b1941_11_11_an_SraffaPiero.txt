Dear Sraffa,
Thanks for the Sedin & your letter. I’m sleeping a bit better now. I shan’t be able to see you next Sunday, except in the morning, but I’m free on Saturday afternoon. I’ll arrive in Cambridge roughly at 4 p.m., but perhaps even earlier. I could come round to your room then or after Hall. Please send a note to my room (tell the porters I’m coming).
So long! 
Ludwig Wittgenstein
