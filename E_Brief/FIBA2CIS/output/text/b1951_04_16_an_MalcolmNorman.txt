Dear Norman,
Thanks for your letter. Apart from a certain weakness which has constant ups & downs I'm feeling very well these days. My room here is much more agreable than the one in Oxford. Not that anyone could possibly be kinder to me than Miss Anscombe was; & I was very happy there, too, while I was ill. But now that I'm up the whole day I prefer it here. Thanks for sending me the book Kon-tiki. I've often heard of it & it's bound to be interesting. ‒ I saw Moore twice recently & had discussions with him. One very bad one, the other fairly good. I was responsible for the bad one's being bad. An extraordinary thing has happened to me. About a month ago I suddenly found myself in the right frame of mind for doing philosophy. I had been absolutely certain that I'd never again be able to do it. It's the first time after more than 2 years that the curtain in my brain has gone up. ‒ Of course, so far I've only worked for about 5 weeks & it may be all over by tomorrow; but it bucks me up a lot now.
I'm indoors most of the time, all the more as the weather is pretty rotten & very cold, but I can go out for short strolls. ‒ I want to go to Oxford before long to visit Smythies & Bouwsma if all goes well with me.
Miss Anscombe sends her good wishes. Give my love to everybody.
Affectionately
Ludwig
Remember me to Dr Mooney. I like to think of her.
