Dear Ogden,
Enclosed please find my declaration as you wanted it.
As to the complimentary copy I don't like the idea of your sending one to anybody at your expense; but I would like to get two or three copies of the book at my expense if I can possibly afford it (please let me know the price). If not I will perhaps ask Russell to lend me the money till I can pay him back.
If you will do me a favour however please be so kind and try to find out Mrs Fany Pinsents address in Birmingham. She is David Pinsents mother to whom I dedicated the book and I must send her a copy. I hope very much you shall be able to find out where she lives and let me know. By the way: if I give to Messr Kegan Paul all publication rights then they ought to print my preface in German too!!! For the preface is part of the book.
If you see Johnson, Keynes or Bond please remember me to them. I wish I could heare of Johnson. Yours sincerely
L Wittgenstein
