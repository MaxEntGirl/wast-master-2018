Dear Sraffa
I wish to try to formulate what it is that irritates you about the thinking of Cambridge people and of me in particular. Couldn’t one say that you feel something of this sort: Here are people who try to speak in a queer way “impartially” about things, they pretend to be able to slip out of their own skins and they speak as though they could understand everybody’s feelings, wishes, tendencies etc. It is as though actors forgot that they weren’t really all the people they impersonated. – When they talk of the claims of different nations they either try to take up the position of a God, impartial, etc.; or if they take sides they have a theory as well which shows them that their side is the only side, and without this theory they wouldn’t dare to take sides.
This, by the way, was what I wished to tell you by my simile about the three religious people. The application of my simile was: You are like, say, a Greek Orthodox who sais: “I like a real protestant – who entirely disagrees with me – better than a man who sais that he is religious and can understand both the protestant and me.”
The only thing that I should say to all this is: Every way of thinking is all right as long as it isn’t stupid. That is: the question is only if in my own way I go far enough. If I do, it’ll lead me out of the thick forest. I’m only afraid of going half way. And I am really afraid of doing so. My way of thinking is all right and I thank God for having given it to me; a different question is whether I make use of what I got in the right way. And in fact I know that I’m not doing so [...]
