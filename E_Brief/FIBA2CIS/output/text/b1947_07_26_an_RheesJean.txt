Dear Mrs Rhees,
Thanks for your note & for allowing me to stay with you. I shall come to London on Aug. 4th & I'll get out to Goldhurst Terrace sometime in the evening, but I don't quite know the time yet as I want to meet someone in town first. Will you be at home in the evening, or could you leave your key somewhere where I can find it? I hope I shan't give you too much trouble! I'm looking forward to seeing you. My plane leaves for Dublin on Aug 6th in the morning.
So long!
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
