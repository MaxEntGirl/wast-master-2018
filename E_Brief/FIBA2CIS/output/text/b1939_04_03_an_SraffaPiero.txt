Title: Von Ludwig Wittgenstein an Piero Sraffa, [3. 4. 1939]

sourceDesc:  Abschrift McGuinness, Kopie in BA. 

Text: 
Dear Sraffa,
I should not recommend S., for personal reasons. B & N I don’t know, but perhaps N would be the right man. C I’ve heard of & I’m slightly doubtful. Remember me to your mother. Good wishes!
Wittgenstein
