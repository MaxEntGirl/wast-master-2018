My dear child
I shall proceed to Bergen on or about Sunday the 19th July (not, earlier) but I am at the moment a little uncertain as to the exact moment as I am going on Monday to Leamington to do a spot of work there & am a little uncertain as to how long it will take. When I can tell you the exact date, will you get hold of a room for me somewhere in Skjolden? Let me know when & you will be going & an adress
hell blast & damn
your soul
Gilbert
P.S. July, not Juli.
