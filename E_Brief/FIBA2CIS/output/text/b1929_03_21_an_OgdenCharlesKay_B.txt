Text: 
Dear Ogden,
Thanks so much for your kind intervention in my business with Messrs Kegan Paul. The reason why I wanted my book is that I had to submit it as a dissertation for the Ph.D. & as this is not going to happen again I will never again want a free copy. In fact even now I wouldn't have complained but that I'm very short of money.
Yours very sincerely
L Wittgenstein
