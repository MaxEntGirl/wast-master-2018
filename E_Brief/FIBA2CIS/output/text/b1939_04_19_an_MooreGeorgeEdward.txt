Dear Moore,
When I talked to you on Monday & last week I thought that I had to start lecturing today, & only yesterday I found out that I wouldn't have to lecture before next Monday. As this gives me another 5 days to collect my thoughts I feel it increases my chance of being able to lecture, & I think, therefore, it might be better if you said nothing about the matter at the Mor. Science Board meeting. (If however you think you ought to that's different.)
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
