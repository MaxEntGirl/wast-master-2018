Dear Rhees,
Thanks for your kind letter. I am getting slowly better & the doctor tells me that after some months I may be well enough to work. (Though I can't imagine that I'll ever work again.) I am sorry that my life should be prolonged in this way. It was a great shock to me to hear of this possibility. But I dare say I'll get accustomed to the idea. Just now I'm incapable of making a plan, or thinking an intelligent thought; that's the worst.
I think of going to Vienna for some time as soon as possible. There I'll just do nothing & let the hormones do their work.
Thanks for everything you said!
I don't know when I'll go to London. To see you will be very good.
As always
Ludwig Wittgenstein
I am completely stupid & full of bad thoughts.
