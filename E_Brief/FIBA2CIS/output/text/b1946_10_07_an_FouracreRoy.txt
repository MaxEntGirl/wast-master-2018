Dear Roy
Thanks for your letter of Sept 24th. Sorry you don't get post regularly, & particularly my letters which are full of content. I mean, paper, ink, & air. ‒ The mosquitos don't bite you because you're so nice ‒ be[c]ause you aren't ‒ but because you're so bl... awful & it[']s the blood they want. ‒ I hope that the Dutch will soon take over for good & send you back!
Look after yourself & be good. Bless you!
As always
Ludwig
