Monday
Dear Moore,
Thanks for your letter. I wish to God you would attend my classes! It would give me ever so much more of a chance to make things clear, to you & to others. Would you come if I promised you to provide a very comfortable chair & tobacco & pipecleaners? I came up a week ago & am leaving for Ireland on Friday & shall be back again on October 1st. I shall try to see you on Tuesday Oct. 2nd, i.e. I'll call & see if you are in. â€’ I'm extremely sorry about Priestley!
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
