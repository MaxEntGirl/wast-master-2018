Dear Saunders,
Thank you very much for your letter, dated March 2nd. Please forgive me for replying so late: I was for a few days unable to decide what to write to you. I greatly appreciate the kindness & generosity of the General Board in offering to pay me a Term’s salary. but I must tell you that I would very much rather not be paid for the work I am doing now. For it isn’t at all clear that the work will not prove to be a wash-out. On the other hand it is of the greatest importance for me that it should be as good as I can make it; & the thought - which I coudn’t get rid of - that I’d have, as it were, to live up to a salary would disturb me & therefore make conditions slightly less favourable.
So, please, just give me leave, without pay. (My health, by the way, is as good as possible.) I hope you don’t think I’m ungrateful, for I’m not.
Yours sincerely, 
L. Wittgenstein
