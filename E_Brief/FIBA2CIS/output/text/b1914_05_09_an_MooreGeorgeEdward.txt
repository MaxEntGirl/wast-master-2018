Text: 
Dear Moore,
Your letter annoied me. When I wrote Logik I didn't consult the Regulations, & therefore I think it would only be fair if you gave me my degree without consulting them so much either! As to a Preface & Notes; I think my examiners will easily see how much I have cribbed from Bosanquet. ‒ If I'm not worth your making an exception for me even in some stupid details then I may as well go to Hell directly; and if I am worth it & you don't do it then ‒ by God ‒ you might go there.
The whole business is too stupid & too beastly to go on writing about it so ‒
L.W.
