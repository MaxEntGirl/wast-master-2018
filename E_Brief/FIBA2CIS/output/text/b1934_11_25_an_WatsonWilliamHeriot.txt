My dear Watson,
I ought to have written to you roughly 9 months ago and have, I think, begun two letters and destroyed them again. Besides I have thought of writing to you roughly every second or third day. But writing becomes the more difficult the longer you postpone it. I am very busy just now. I have two pupils 5 times a week for 4 hours on end from 9:30 to 1:30, with a pause in which we drink coffee. In these hours I mainly dictate to them and what I dictate may one day be published, or may not. Besides this little class I have got my official one for three hours a week. We have a very nice and good man here just now, he is lecturer in philosophy and comes to my classes. His name is Wisdom. He works very hard in my classes and is good and agreeable in discussion and thereby a great help both for me and the other pupils. I thank God that I am able to work hard again, for from the middle of August to the beginning of October I felt utterly slack and incapable of holding on to a single decent thought. It was a rotten time. The one good thing about it was that I spent 2 weeks of it with Skinner (whom perhaps you remember) and Drury in Ireland. I hope I shall hear from you before long, though it's true that I don't deserve it.
Have you heard that Priestley leaves Cambridge? He has been made permanent Vice Chancellor of the University at Melbourne. It's a terrible loss for Cambridge and a very bad one for me too. For I'm very fond of him!
With the very best wishes
Yours ever
Ludwig Wittgenstein
