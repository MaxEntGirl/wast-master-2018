Dear von Wright,
Thanks for your letter. I am near London right now & am leaving for Vienna on Wednesday next. I'm coming back on Sept 29th & then should like to spend a fortnight or so in Cambridge to dictate some stuff of mine. I am looking forward to seeing you then. I shall not try to see you before leaving as I'm not in the right frame of mind for a conversation; but I hope we'll have good talks after my return from Austria.
I shan't write more now. I'm feeling very stupid.
All good wishes!
So long!
Ludwig Wittgenstein
