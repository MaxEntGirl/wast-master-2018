Dear Rhees,
The Term's over & my thoughts travel in the direction of Swansea. I've been working fairly well since Easter. I am now dictating some stuff, remarks, some of which I (want to embody in my first volume (if there'll ever be one). This business of dictating will take roughly another month, or 6 weeks. After that I could leave Cambridge. Do you think it would be all right for me to come to Swansea? One question is of course, can I stay with Morgan? &, if not, can I stay elsewhere?
It seems I could come about the end of July. That is, if it's all right with you.
I think it'll interest you to hear that I have had two letters from my two sisters in Austria. How they (the letters) got to England I don't know (not by post however). They (my sisters) don't say where they are (but I can guess). They seem to be well but are without news from their friends in Vienna. I think you met my niece Mariechen. Her two older boys are missing. They may, of course, be prisoners of war. I have had a letter from Arvid Sjögren who is in Stockholm. ‒ Drury is in Guent & will probably go to the, Ruhrgebiet soon. I have an idea that what he'll see there will shock him.
I hope you haven't had too bad a Term &/or too stupid students!
You'll ask: "What's 'too stupid'?" ‒
Let me hear from you! Give my good wishes to Mrs Rhees.
Good luck!
So long ‒
Ludwig Wittgenstein
