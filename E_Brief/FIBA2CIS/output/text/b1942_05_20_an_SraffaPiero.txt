Dear Sraffa,
Please drop the enclosed letter into Dr. Nourse’s letterbox. It’s an important letter & I don’t know his house-number, or his initials. I am out of bed a great part of the day now but frightfully weak & still having some trouble with my head & back, which makes me feel pretty wretched. I am back again in my room in [[[[PLACE:Nuffield House]]]]Nuffield House[[[[/PLACE]]]]. I’ll have to stay here probably for at least a week before I’m strong enough to travel, climb stairs, etc. Give my best wishes to your mother.
So long! 
Ludwig Wittgenstein
