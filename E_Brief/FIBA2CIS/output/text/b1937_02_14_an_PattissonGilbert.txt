Dear Gilbert,
ℵ *) Thanks ever so much for the stopper!! "Both fit & stile are perfect" ‒ as they always write to Mr Burton, the taylor of taste.
My rib is all right again & I am fairly well.
Remember me to your parents & to your sister. Tell her that the food here is quite as good as it is in England.
P.S. You do not mention the cheque but I take this to mean that you've got it all right. If not please let me know.
Bloodily
Ludwig
* This, I believe, is an 'Aleph'.
