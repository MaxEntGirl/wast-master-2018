Dear Gilbert,
Thanks for the 'Easy-Fill' Filler which is even sweller than I thought. I didn't know the particular kind which one can travel with. ‒ I hope to get the typed letter to Messrs Lyons soon, for we ought to send it off before doomsday if possible, as there is, I think, no delivery that day.
I am in good health & working fairly well. The weather has changed from marvelous to rotten. It rains like hell now. Two days ago we had the first snow. (This rime was not intended.) ‒ I enclose the photos I took on our trip. It's difficult for me however to get any copies done here. So please have those which I have packed separately copied again (one of each) & send me the copies. Woolworth will do them. Also please send me a copy of each of your photos (I mean of those you took). And if you're at it, please send me three bottles of 'Genasprin' (2s each) & please subtract the amount from the money you have of me!
I needn't say that I should like to hear from you.
Please remember me to your parents & to your sister.
bl...
Ludwig
