Dear Roland,
I couldn't send you the stuff before today as I had no time to post it. Two days ago I had a letter from Ffennell, from Washington where he is with the British Admiralty Delegation. He says he feels more happy, on the whole, in America than he did in England. His work doesn't seem to give him satisfaction. He asks me if I have heard from you or seen you or Goodstein. The letter sounds fairly normal although he still dramatises himself a bit.
I hope Lotte is level-headed & in a good frame of mind.
Good wishes!
Ludwig
