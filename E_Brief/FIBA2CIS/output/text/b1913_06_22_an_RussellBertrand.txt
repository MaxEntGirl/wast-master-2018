Dear Russell,
Would you be so kind as to forward the enclosed letter to Mrs W., I have forgotten her address.
I am affraid there are no logical news today. The weather here is most abominable, it rains all the day like mad! Just now a crash of thunder came down & I said "Hell!", which shows that english swear-words are well in my bones. I hope I can send you some logical news soon. If you have nothing better to do please let me know how you are etc.
Yours ever most etc.
L. W.
