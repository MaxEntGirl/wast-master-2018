Text: 
My Dear Keynes,
Please kindly forward the enclosed letter to Russells address. I wish I could see him somehow or other, for I am sure he won't be able to understand my book without a very thorough explanation, which cann't be written. Have you done any more work on probability? My M.S. contains a few lines about it which, I believe, â€’ solve the essential question.
Yours ever
Ludwig Wittgenstein
