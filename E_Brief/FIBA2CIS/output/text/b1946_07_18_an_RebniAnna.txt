Text: 
Dear Frøken Rebni, 
I am sending this letter by a friend, Mr Ben Richards who is going to Norway on a climbing tour. Please be nice & kind to him, & think you're doing it for me. I still think of you quite often & I hope you don't find life too difficult. I was extremely sorry to hear of Arne Drægni's death. He was the best friend I had in Skjolden. I hope I shall be able to come to Norway next year & I hope to see you then.
All good wishes!
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
