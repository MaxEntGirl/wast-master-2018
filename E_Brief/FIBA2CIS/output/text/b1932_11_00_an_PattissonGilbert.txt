Dear Gilbert,
a) I shall arrive at Kings + on Friday (tomorrow) at 6.37
b) Thanks for reserving a room at the Palace. But why not at your Hotel? Or don't you want to have breakfast with me?
c) I maligned my room when I said that the dormer-window* could not be opened. The chambermaid showd me afterwards that it could; only by a very complicated technique which I couldn't have guessed alone.
d) I just now notice that the address given on your p.c. is Argyll Rd., so I assume that perhaps you are no longer at the White Hall of our Fathers.
e) I am yours in bl.
Ludwig
The word "dormer-window" I have just found in the dictionary it is a translation of the German "Dachfenster"
