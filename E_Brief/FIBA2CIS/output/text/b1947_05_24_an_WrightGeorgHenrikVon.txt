TRINITY COLL. CAMB.
Saturday
Dear v. Wright,
Thanks for your letter. Sorry you weren't able to come to my class! Not that you lost anything. ‒ The two items I bring along with this letter are not meant to be looked at, but to be eaten. Of the vitamin B, you take a tablet a day. It can't do you any harm but may do you a lot of good; it has helped me when I was run down. The black currant puree was given to me as a present. I pass it on because I really don't need it; you do! Don't make any fuss but eat it. ‒ I was very glad to read the kind words you said in your letter about Kreisel & Miss Anscombe. (I, too, respect both of them very much.) You made a "?" over Miss Anscombes name, ‒ I wonder, why. You couldn't possibly have mistaken Mrs Braithwaite for her, could you? ‒ I shall expect you on Monday morning between 9.30 & 10.30 in my room. I very much hope you'll soon recover.
So long!
L. Wittgenstein
