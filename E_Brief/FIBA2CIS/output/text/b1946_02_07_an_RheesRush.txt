7.2.46.
Dear Rhees,
Of course you must give my name ‒ & why in hell ask, when I've asked you to do it 100 times?! ‒ I'ld like you to get the Dundee job but I'ld like it better if Britton got it & you got his job ‒ for obvious reasons. ‒ My lecture[s] aren't too terribly bad but they're pretty poor. I'm talking about problems of Gestalt psychology & am frightfully unclear myself & unable to get to the deep aspects of the matter. My class too is very primitive & often when I talk of 'tribes' I think the most primitive tribe is right in front of me. ‒ I feel mentally & morally mixed up. ‒
So long!
Ludwig Wittgenstein
