Dear v. Wright,
My eldest sister died very peacefully yesterday evening. We had expected her end hourly for the last 3 days. It wasn't a shock.
I'm in very good health. I see Miss Anscombe 2-3 times a week, & we even had a discussion the other day which wasn't too bad. â€’ I was very glad indeed to hear that Geache's lectures are good. Frege was just the right food for him!
Please give my love to all my friends.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
