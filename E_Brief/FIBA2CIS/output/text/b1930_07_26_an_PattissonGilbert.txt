Dear Gil, (old beast)
You have a goal of ambition; of course you have; otherwise you'd be a mere drifter, with the spirit of a mouse rather than of man. You are not content to stay where you are. You want something more out of life. You desire a better position & larger earnings for the benefit of yourself & those who are (or will be) dependent on you!
How, you may ask, can I lift myself out of the ranks of the ill paid?? Do think about these & other problem[s.] I have retired to the above address which is a country place about 3 hours journey from Vienna. I have purchassed a new big writing book of which I enclose the label & am doing a good deal of work. I also enclose my photo which has been taken recently. The top of my head has been removed as I don't want it for philosophysing. I have found Pelmanism the most usefull method for the organisation of thought. The little grey books have made it possible to "card-index" my mind. ‒ Somehow or other one instructively feels that Two Steeples Nr83 Quality Sock is a real mans sock. It's a sock of taste-dressy, fashionable, comfortable. If you have nothing better to do let me hear from you (even if you feel that you cann't write a letter, anything as good as this)
Yours ever
Ludwig
