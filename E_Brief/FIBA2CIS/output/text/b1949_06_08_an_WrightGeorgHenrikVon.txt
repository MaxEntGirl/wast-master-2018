Dear v. Wright,
Thanks for your card. I'm afraid I have to bother you with another question. I don't quite know yet whether I'm getting better; but if so, it's a very slow process. Now I'd like to come to Cambridge on Monday, or Tuesday the week after next (i.e. June 20th or 21st) & although I think I'll be a good deal stronger by then I may still not be able to walk about a lot, & hence, to go to restaurants for my meals may not be possible for me. That means that I may have to stay in a place where they give me all my meals. Now I don't know if that wouldn't be more than your household could do & if it wouldn't be, at least, a frightful nuisance to your family. Please write me a line about it & be very frank. I'm sorry that there should be all these difficulties & you know that I'm not happy about them, either, but I can't change them.
Wish me luck! & the same to you!
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
P.S. In case you see Kreisel, please give him my good wishes & tell him to ask Gitta Deutsch if she can do some typing for me when I come to Cambridge. She's the girl that's typed for me in the past & she is a friend of Kreisels.
