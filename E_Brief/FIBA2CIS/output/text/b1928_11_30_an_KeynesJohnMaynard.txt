Text: 
My dear Keynes,
I ve just finished my house that has kept me entirely busy these last two years. Now however I will have some holidays & naturaly want to see you again as soon as possible. The question is, would you mind seeing me. If not, write a line. I could come to England in the first days of December but not before, as I must first set to rights part of my anatomy. Enclosed you will find a few photos of my house & hope you wont be too much disgusted by its simplicity
Yours ever
Ludwig
Wien III Kundmanngasse 19
Write soon!
