Dear Norman,
Dear Lee,
I was glad to hear that you had a little boy, chiefly because I imagine that that's what you wanted. If all that's wrong with him is that he looks like Norman, I dare say he'll live that down. May everything go smoothly with him & you & Ray!! ‒ The Rockefeller people didn't write to me, & I don't see that they had any reason; I never wrote to them. Nor could I ever see why they should give me a grant ‒ though it would have been nice if they had done. ‒ I'm pretty well, & I'm working but not particularly well. I get tired soon. The climate here, too, is very relaxing. (But I'm not making that responsible.) ‒ As I wrote to you, I planned to go to Norway in August, but I can't go; I may go in Autumn. The man with whom I thought of going has to cram for an exam which he failed in July. So maybe I'll see Bouwsma when he arrives here in August. I have hardly any philosophical discussions. I could see students if I wanted, but I don't want to. I've got all sorts of unclear thoughts in my old head which perhaps will remain there for ever in this unsatisfactory state.
If ever I became clearer again, which is very unlikely, it would be good to have some more talks with you. ‒ Give my good wishes to Doney, if he's still within reach.
Let me hear from you again before long.
As always,
affectionately
Ludwig
P.S. Thanks for the jacket. I'd forgotten all about it & it's mended beautifully!
