Text: 
Dear Sraffa, 
I meant to ask you what was the name of the preparation against bugs which you once mentioned to me. I think you said that you had the stuff with you in Russia. Also please let me know where one can get it, if you happen to know. – 
I said to you today that I would write to you sometime, but in fact I think that it wouldn’t be quite natural for me to write to you; unless one day I see clearly that you were right in the essential points of our conversations, or, if I should ever see clearly that you were wrong. All I can now say is this: that there is something fundamentally wrong with me. – if a layman with healthy eyes looks at a bad portrait he sees that it is bad & will often tell you straightaway what is wrong in it, in his opinion; he will insist, say, that the nose is too long. The painter can then safely take it from him that the portrait is bad; but he would as a rule be ill advised to shorten the nose. For it is one thing to see that a picture is bad, & an entirely different thing to see where the fault lies. – Thus, when you look into me you see that here is something wrong – & I agree – but whether in showing what is wrong you point to the right spot is very doubtfull, – & perhaps not really relevant, as it is my job anyway to do something to put it right. Let us hope that this shall really be done & that one day I shall feel allright. Yours 
Ludwig Wittgenstein
