Dear Wittgenstein, 
In my unregistered letter posted on Monday I asked you for the Supplements; and about the omission of the title, as unusual in book printing. [I should add that it was not proposed to print your Preface in German as well as English, but only the numbered text and supplements, involving ambiguities.]
There are two further questions as regards printing
(1) in English the quotation marks are "‒" and in German „‒“ We can keep the German method for the German text.
(2) In your German text you always have italics indicated by "gesperrt" letters. We could use italics instead, I suppose?
We have now been carefully through every one of your points and been able to make use of them all in some way.
I might mention that the corrections in ink were not by Russell but by the translator, so I hope you did not anywhere respect them too much.
Yours sincerely,
C. K. Ogden
P.S. I have had all sentences where there is still a verbal difference required or suggested after reading your notes. Perhaps you can pass them all as satisfactory; but I am telling the printers to wait until I receive them back from you. So I hope you can check them & return them registered very soon.
There is a special point as regards the formula 4.27 & 4.42 which F. P. Ramsey (the Trinity mathematical prodigy) thinks I ought to bring to your notice for confirmation. Pinned on to this
Later I have just seen the printers, & they will do both the quotations and the gesperrt letters just as in German.
