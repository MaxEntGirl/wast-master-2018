Testimonial
I have known Mr. R. Rhees for 4 years; he has attended my lectures on philosophy and we have had a great many discussions both on philosophical and general subjects. I have always been strongly impressed by the great seriousness and intelligence with which he tackles any problem.
Mr. Rhees is an exceptionally kind and helpful man and will spare no trouble to assist his students.
His German is very good indeed.
