My dear Norman,
I want to ask me a great favour. It is simply that you do not under any circumstances let any one know about the nature of my illness who doesn't already know about it. The same goes double for Lee. This is of the greatest importance for me as I plan to go to Vienna for Christmas & not to let my family know about the real disease. â€’ von Wright told me that Lee in her great kindness has sent a parcel off for me to Ireland. I'll get it in good time. Thanks for all your kindness (I mean the two of you.). I shall probably not be able to send you a proper X-mas present at all; perhaps a shabby & belated one. Give my love to Lee & to Dr Mooney & to Doney & Bouwsma. I am slowly getting stronger again.
Affectionately
Ludwig
