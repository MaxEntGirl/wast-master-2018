Text: 
Cambridge 22.6.12.
Dear Russell,
There are yet some nice events happening in one's life e.g. geting a letter from you (thanks very much for it). Much less nice is the following event: I had a discussion with Myers about the relations between Logic & Psychology. I was very candid & I am sure he thinks that I am the most arrogant devil who ever lived. Poor Mrs Myers who was also present got ‒ I think ‒ quite wilde about me. However, I think he was a bit less confused after the discussion than before. ‒ Whenever I have time I now read James's "Varieties of religious exp.". This book does me a lot of good. I don't mean to say that I will be a saint soon, but I am not sure that it does not improve me a little in a way in which I would like to improve very much: namely I think that it helps me to get rid of the Sorge (in the sense in which Goethe used the word in the 2nd part of Faust). Logic is still in the melting pot but one thi[n]g gets more & more obvious to me: The props of Logic contain only apparent variables & whatever may turn out to be the proper explanation of apparent variables, it's co[n]sequence must be that there are no logical constants. Logic must turn out to be of a totaly different kind than any other science.
The peace of poetry which you sent me is most splendid! Do come to Cambridge soon.
Yours most etc.
Ludwig Wittgenstein
I am staying here till about 20th of July.
