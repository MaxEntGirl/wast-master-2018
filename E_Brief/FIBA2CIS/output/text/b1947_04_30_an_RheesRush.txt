Dear Rhees,
Thanks for your letter & the paper. Our letters crossed & I have, meanwhile, heard that my bag has left Swansea & that I have paid for it, though it hasn't yet arrived, but I'm told that there's still hope. I won't attempt to write a criticism of your article, except to say that I agree with its tendency & partly with the way it's expressed. Polemic, or the art of throwing eggs, is, as you well know, as highly skilled a job as say boxing. Where I disagree with your article it isn't because I think it hits too hard (I don't think that's possible) but perhaps because I think that there are not enough square blows & too many gestures: Needless to say, I couldn't have produced as good an article, & it's better to produce something in the right direction than to produce nothing. I'ld love you to throw eggs at Ryle ‒ but keep your face straight & throw them well! The difficulty is: not to make superfluous noises, or gestures, which don't harm the other man but only yourself. Forgive me this preaching. It may be stupid but the intension's good. And please write against Ryle if you possibly can. ‒ I found Drury perfectly normal. He talked with great intelligence about his illness. He is going to stay in Dublin as Dr Moore's assistant until X-mas. How far he is safe, I mean, how likely it is that his former state will return, that, of course, I don't know, & I don't feel in the least sanguine about it.
So long! Thanks for everything!
Ludwig Wittgenstein
