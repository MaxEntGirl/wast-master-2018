Dear Moore,
I'm sorry I can't come on Tuesday, but I can & shall on Friday, & I'm looking forward to it. â€’ Looking through a copy of the stuff I gave you I see that there are a good many nasty misprints, i.e. such as suggest a wrong sense. If I have an opportunity I'll correct them.
Yours
L. Wittgenstein
