Dear Pink,
Would you be so very kind as to send me one of my note-books to the above address? The one I mean stands on a shelf of my ‘book-case’; it is roughly quarto size, about ½ inch thick, or less, it has flexible black covers. If this isn’t on the shelf, there’s another one with cardboard covers black & white marbled & a white lable (like a copy book). I don’t mean the fat one that looks like a ledger & has a red back. I’d prefer the black flexible one.
 I’m a good deal better than when you saw me last.
I hope you’re moderately well. If Smythies is still about, please give him my good wishes & also to Father Pepler.
yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
