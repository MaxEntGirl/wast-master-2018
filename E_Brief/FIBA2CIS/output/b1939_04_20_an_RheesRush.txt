Dear Rhees,
Just come to my classes (the first one will be on Monday at 5 p.m.). If anyone says anything I'll deal with them. I'll be very glad to see you there but I know my performances will be awful. I'm upset by all sorts of things & don't yet see at all how I'll be able to concentrate my thoughts sufficiently As to say anything worth saying. I'm feeling very funky indeed.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
