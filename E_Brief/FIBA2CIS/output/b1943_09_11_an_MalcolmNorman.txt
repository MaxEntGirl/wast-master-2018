11.9.43.
Dear Malcolm,
I haven't written to you for a long time & haven't heard from you for ages.
19.9.43. These lines I wrote a week ago & then was interrupted. The next day your letter arrived. I was very glad to hear from you. It would be ever so good to see you again. I too regret that for external & internal reasons I can't do philosophy, for that's the only work that's given me real satisfaction. No other work really bucks me up. I'm extremely busy now & my mind is kept occupied the whole time but at the end of the day I just feel tired & sad. ‒ Well, perhaps better times will come again. ‒ I haven't heard from Smythies for many months. I know he is in Oxford but he doesn't write to me. ‒ Lewy is still at Cambridge, which, I'm sure, is very bad for him & not good for anyone else. Rhees is still lecturing at Swansea & as good as ever. I very rarely come to Cambridge now, about once every three months. I've given up my rooms in College. I'm supposed, of course, to come back there as a professor after the war, but I must say I can't quite imagine how I'll be able to do it. I wonder if I'll ever be able to teach philosophy again regularly. I rather think I shan't be able.
I hope you'll see Moore & find him in good health. I hear the book about him has appeared ‒ but I shan't read it. ‒
Write to me again before long! Good luck!
Affectionately
Ludwig Wittgenstein
