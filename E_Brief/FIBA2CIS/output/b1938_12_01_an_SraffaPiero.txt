Dear Sraffa,
One more point has occured to me which may be rather important. If you accept the Trinity post – though you don’t know whether it’ll in the end be good or bad for you in the ways we talked about – you do know that it will be a change of position & thereby may help to uproot you. I.e., you’ll have to get up from your present chair & sit down on another one. It will therefore teach you new things, & that’s a point in favour of accepting.
In a sense, you will loose your job & get another one; which is at least some motion. And, as I said, it will teach you new things, give you an experience which perhaps you ought to have. (I don’t think it for one moment wrong to accept on those grounds. There is nothing flippant in this.) (I know what can be said against it.)
Ludwig Wittgenstein
Now read this letter again, da capo al fine!
