Dear Sraffa,
I had a letter this morning from my friend, the teacher, whom I had asked for information, saying that the decision would be made on April 5th & that it looks as though it would be favourable. The letter is all written in a kind of code but on the whole, it seems that things might be worse than they are. – I wrote to Adrian last night so he’ld have the letter first thing this morning if he’s in Cambridge. I asked him to send me an answer as soon as possible. Would it suit you if I came round to you on Monday at about 2.30? So long! Wittgenstein
