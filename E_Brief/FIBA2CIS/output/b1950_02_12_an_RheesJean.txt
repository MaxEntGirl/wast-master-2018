Dear Mrs Rhees,
My eldest sister died peacefully last night.
I intend to stay here for another month, or so & should very much like to stay with you for a short time when I come back, if you can put me up. I hope I shan't be as much trouble then as the last time. I'm in very good health now, even my nerves are in good shape. May it stay that way for a little while longer!
Good wishes!
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
