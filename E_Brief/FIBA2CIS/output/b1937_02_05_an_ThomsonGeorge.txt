Dear George,
I haven’t yet thanked you & Mrs Thomson for your most kind letter. It did me good to get it.
When I saw you I said I would leave Cambridge in a few days. But I couldn’t do so for I got ‘flu & had to stay in bed for a few days. I left England on the 23rd Jan. still feeling a bit weak. And, absurd as it may sound, I think I haven’t yet quite recovered, for my head feels stupid & dull & my work doesn’t isn’t going well at all. I dare say things will improve before long.
I hope you’re finding Birmingham a tolerably agreeable place & the students not too dull.
Please remember me to your wife.
Best wishes & thanks again!
Ever yours
Ludwig
