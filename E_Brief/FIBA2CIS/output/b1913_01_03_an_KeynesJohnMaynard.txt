Dear Keynes,
Thanks for your very kind letter. I thought of writing to you just before I got it to tell you that I will not be able to come over to England untill or after the beginning of term, there being all sorts of troubles at home. â€’ I excuse your slanging Philosophy as you were just coming from McTaggart & just thinking of me when you did it. I am very glad to heir that you had a good time.
Yours etc. etc.
Ludwig Wittgenstein
