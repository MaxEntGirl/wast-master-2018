Dear Malcolm,
Your letter & the magazines arrived here simultaneously a day or two ago. I found them here today on returning from a week end excursion to Hastings. Thanks awfully! I'm sure they're grand. My critical eye can see that without having read them, because my critical eye is an X-ray eye & can penetrate from 2 to 4000 pages. That's in fact how I got all my learning. Now please take it easy! One magazine a month is ample. If you send me more I won't have time to do any philosophy. Also please don't waste your money on mags for me, & see that you get enough to eat! I'm glad to say Smythies has got unconditional exemption. I shall give him your regards when I see him tomorrow & as I know that he'll send you his I give them to you right now. My lectures have gone moderately well this term & I hope they won't be too awful next term. I'm feeling a bit run down just now. I'm extremely glad that you've found kind people to stay with. I wish you lots of good & decent thoughts.
Yours affectionately
Ludwig Wittgenstein
