Text: 
Skjolden i Sogn
Thursday 4.3.
Dear Moore,
This is only to say that I wish to hear from you. ‒ My work hasn't been going well since I came back here. Partly because I've been troubled about myself a lot. In the last few days I've been able to work a bit better, but still only very moderately. The days are getting longer now & that cheers me up, but I still don't see the sun from where I live (Though in the village it shines for many hours.)
Give my love to Wisdom & tell him, please, to write to me occasionally. Have you heard from Rees? I suppose you haven't seen Skinner, or I would have heard it from him. Though I wish you had! ‒
I enclose two stamps which might be of use to Mrs Moore. Please remember me to her. I hope to hear from you soon.
Lots of good wishes!
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
