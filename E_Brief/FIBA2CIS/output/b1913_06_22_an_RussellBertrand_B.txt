Dear Russell
your axiom of reducibility is ; now is this not all nonsense as this prop. has only then a meaning if we can turn the ϕ into an apparent variable. For if we cannot do so no general laws can ever follow from your axiom. The whole axiom seems to me at present a mere juggling trick. Do let me know if there is more in it. The axiom as you have put it is only a schema & the real Pp ought to be , & where would be the use of that?! ‒ Thanks for your letter. I am working very hard. I look forward very much to see you in one of the last daies of August because I have lots & lots of things to tell you.
Yours ever etc.
L. W.
