Monday
Dear Moore,
I think I ought to let you know that I am not going to come to tea with you on Tuesdays. I ought to have written this to you 2 or 3 weeks ago & in fact I wrote a letter to you about a fortnight ago but destroyed it again. Then I left Cambridge for a week & postponed writing to you & forgot about it. Please forgive me my negligence.
I also want you to know that my reason for not coming is a lack of friendliness which you showed on two occasions, the second when we last meet. (You weren't unfriendly). Your behaviour then made me think that the way we used to meet wasn't quite the right expression of our actual relation. I know this is expressed very badly but you'll understand me.
If you will allow me occasionally to turn up at your at home after tea I'll do so.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
