Dear Roy,
I'm feeling by far better now than I did at the beginning of Term. I then felt very lousy & had queer attacks of exhaustion. Finally in despair I went to see a physician here in Cambridge who was known to me as quite a good & conscientious man, but I felt sure that he couldn't really help me. Well, he advised me this & that & in the end he mentioned that I might try a Vitamin B preparation, as a deficiency in Vit. B sometimes had effects as the ones I had described to him. So, I took Vit. B. tablets, without the slightest hope that they'd help, & to my great surprise they did help. I'm taking them regularly now & I haven't had any more attacks of exhaustion. â€’ In fact, when I'm all tanked up with Vit. B I get so witty that the jokes get jammed & can't came out. Isn't that terrible?
The weather's chilly & damp, on the whole, & when you come home you might bring a little heat from Sumatra with you. The mosquitos you can leave behind, except a few perhaps for my enemies.
I hope you'll come soon. Look after yourself.
God bless you!
So long!
Ludwig
