Dear Moore,
My address is: L. W. c/o H. Draegni, Skjolden, Sogn, Norway. The place is very nice and I have got plenty of time to work. Identity plays hell with me! Please ask Russell whether he has got my letter because I am not certain if it has been posted. Let me know exactly how you are.
Yours etc. etc.
L. Wittgenstein
