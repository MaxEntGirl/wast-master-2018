Dear Rhees,
This is only to let you know that the doctor's advice, to take vitamin B, seems to have been a good one. The fact is that several hours after taking it for the first time ('Benerva', Roche) I felt much less exhausted, in spite of hardish work, & I haven't had another of my queer attacks since. (I'm taking it regularly now). Try it; it might do you good & it can't harm you. Of course, it's only 5 days since I started. On Friday I lectured (as usual) from 5 to 7 & then attended a Moral Sc. Club meeting from 8.30 to 11, a lousy meeting, by the way, in which an ass, Dr Popper from London, talked more mushy rubbish than I've heard for a long time. I talked a lot (as usual) & felt no bad effects. I couldn't conceivably have done this the week before. This state mayn't last, but now, at my rate, it exists (or subsists?). May the weather not be too bloody hard on you!
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
