Dear Gilbert, I feel a good deal better today than when I left London. I really think I'm recovering. ‒ I arrived here this morning & have decided not to go on to Trondhjem direct but to go to Skjolden first either just for a few days or perhaps for good if I can find a suitable place to stay there ‒ which is unlikely. Poste Restante Trondhjem will however reach me in the end. In about 2 or 3 days I shall know what I'll do. It is queer, but I suddenly felt strongly that I ought first to see Skjolden although it means a tedious journey. Thanks for everything. I shall let you know soon what I've decided. Bloodily
Ludwig
