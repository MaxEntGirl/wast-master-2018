.Dear Russell,
On arriving here I found my father very ill. There is no hope that he may recover. These circumstances have ‒ I am affraid ‒ rather lamed my thoughts & I am muddled allthough I struggle against it. I had a long discussion with Frege about our Theory of Symbolism of which I think, he roughly understood the generall outline. He said he would think the matter over. The complex-problem is now clearer to me & I hope very much that I may solve it. I wish I knew how you are & what sort of time you are having, & all about you!
Yours ever most etc.
Ludwig Wittgenstein
