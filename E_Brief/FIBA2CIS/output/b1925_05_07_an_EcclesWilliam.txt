Dear E.
Thanks so much for your letter dated March 14th. Excuse me for letting you wait so long for an answer. I was very glad you wrote such a long letter, letting me know all about you but I'm afraid I can't write much in return about myself. All the things I should like to write about are so fearfully complicated, much to complicated for my bad English. ‒ As to coming to England this summer, I should like to see you & some other friends very much indeed and I think I will come & make use of your kind offer ‒ but I'm not at all sure my visit will be really a success. England may not have changed since 1913 but I have. However, it's no use writing about that as I couldn't explain to you the exact nature of the change (allthough I perfectly understand it) you will see it yourself when I get there. I should like to come about the End of August. ‒ I'm awfully sorry I shall not see your aunt Mrs Moore. I liked her very much.
Now for your questions: I am not married & consequently haven't got children. My mother is getting very old. Bodily she is rather well now, but her mind has suffered greatly from the sorrows & excitements of the war. My two brothers & myself were in the army, one was killed, the other one & myself were captive in Russia & Italy and my mother didn't know for many months whether we were alive or dead. ‒
Please remember me to your wife and to Dr Moore.
Yours ever
Ludwig Wittgenstein
