Dear Sir,
I'm sorry I caused you the trouble of writing to me. I shall try to explain why the presence of two new people in my class, the other day, greatly disturbed me. â€’ I am, in my classes, doing my utmost to explain a very difficult matter to the students who have been attending my classes this term. I know that it is quite impossible for any one coming in in the middle, or at the end, of the term to get an idea of what we really are driving at. In fact he must necessarily get wrong ideas. I hope you will understand this, & if you do you will also understand why being aware of this fact disturbs me a lot when I should be concentrating entirely on my subject. If I could, as many other people can, prepare my lectures in writing & then read them off in front of the class the presence of new people would not disturb me. But as I'm unable to do this & have to think things out afresh while I'm talking I am very easily disturbed.
In answer to your letter I suggest, therefore, that if you wish to come to my classes you should begin at the beginning of next term; but please don't come to the last few lectures (2 or 3) in this term. I hope you will see my point & not think me unfriendly in suggesting this.
Yours sincerely
L. Wittgenstein
P.S. If you like, come round to my rooms (at the above address) at 4.30 p.m. tomorrow. It may be easier for me to explain the matter to you when I see you than by writing. If you can't come don't bother to reply. I shan't wait for you longer than until 4.45 p.m.
