Dear Moore,
I had a p.c. on Wednesday from Keynes saying that he would like to see the English version of my book, or whatever is ready of it. I needn't say the whole thing is absurd as he couldn't even make head or tail of it if it were translated very well. But as a matter of fact the translation is pretty awful as I saw today when I tried to go through it in order to correct it before giving it to Keynes. Though I worked quite hard on it the whole day with Smythies we only did 12 pages, because masses of it had to be altered. Tomorrow I must go on with it because tomorrow night Keynes ought to get it. So I'm afraid I shan't be able to come to you in the afternoon. I have written to Keynes that you have read the first half of my first volume & could give him some information about it; for obviously you must be able to get more out of reading the original than Keynes could get out of a bad translation & in a hurry. So I hope he'll ask you to give him your opinion. By the way, please don't mention to anyone that I don't think highly of the translation. Rhees did his very best & the stuff is damn difficult to translate.
I hope to see you soon. Best wishes!
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
