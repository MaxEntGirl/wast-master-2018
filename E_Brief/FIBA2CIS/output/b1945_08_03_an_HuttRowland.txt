Dear Roland,
I'm sorry to say it now seems that we shan't see each other this summer. I shall, in all probability, be in Swansea at the end of this month. I plan to go there today week. I feel rather run down & I think I need a change badly & soon if I want to be in working order by October. I've been working hard & shall have to work during the rest of the vac, but I need a change of atmosphere. I am really sorry that I shan't be able to stay with you. Perhaps I could do it in the beginning of October; if your mother should then, by any chance, be away. Let me know!
My address in Swansea will be c/o Rhees 96, Bryn Rd.
How long I'll be able to stay there I don't yet know. But I'ld like to stay till the end of September or the beginning of October.
Good luck!
I hope to see you before too long.
Ludwig
