Dear Russell,
Two years ago, or so, I promised you to send you a M.S. of mine. Now the one I'm sending you today isn't that M.S.. I'm still pottering about with it & God knows whether I will ever publish it, or any of it. But two years ago I held some lectures in Cambridge & dictated some notes to my pupils so that they might have something to carry home with them, in their hands if not in their brains. And I had these notes duplicated. I have just now been correcting misprints & other mistakes in some of the copies & the idea came into my mind whether you might not like to have a copy. So I'm sending you one. I don't wish to suggest that you should read the lectures; but if you should have nothing better to do & if you should get some mild enjoyment out of them I would be very pleased indeed. (I think it is very difficult to understand them, as so many points are just hinted at. They were meant only for the people who heard the lectures.) As I say if, you don't read them it doesn't matter at all.
Yours ever
Ludwig Wittgenstein
