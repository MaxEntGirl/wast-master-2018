 Dear Miss Rand,
I’m sorry to say I shan’t be able to lecture this term as I’m leaving London & moving to Newcastle, which is too far from Cambridge. I hope you will find a place where you’ll be able to work satisfactorily for yourself & others. The address ›Trinity College‹ will always find me.
Good wishes! 
Yours sincerely 
L. Wittgenstein
