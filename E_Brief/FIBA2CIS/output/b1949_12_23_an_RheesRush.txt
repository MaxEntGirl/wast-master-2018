Hearty Greetings
People journey through the snow,
On their way to church they go,
The bells ring out their tuneful call
Bringing peace to one and all.
And so, let peace be with you, too,
And bring you joy the New Year through.
Christmas Greetings
and all good wishes
for the Coming Year
Dear Rhees,
I'm going to Vienna on Dec. 23rd. I intend to stay 2 or 3 months & then to come back. And then I will see you God being willing.
As always
Ludwig Wittgenstein
Give my love to Mrs Rhees
