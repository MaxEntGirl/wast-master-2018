Dear Wittgenstein,
It was pleasant to hear from you again
‒ I ought to have made it clear that Ostwald's people did send me the typescript ‒ and on the day your letter arrived the Annalen itself appeared. I send both to you registered at once, with a postcard.
Yes, do correct both the German type and the translation as heavily as you wish; until you are as satisfied as you wish to be; and send everything back registered; as it is precious at this stage.
The translators will be very interested to see your suggestions and if any queries remain they will, if necessary, submit points to you again.
[I am not sure whether I made clear the reason of the query as to the shape of the field of vision; if it were etwa  Zeichnung   an isosceles triangle in conformity with the laws of optics, & not  Zeichnung  , the printers would not have to get two special diagrams made, & would thereby save about 20,000 Kronen = 10 £! But this of course is a minor matter, & if there is the slightest object in the rounded ends of course we must have them.]
Your spelling is still very good! ‒ but I will watch it personally.
I hope we may meet again before long. Twice I have nearly been to München, but not quite; & have not been out of England since 1914.
Yours sincer[e]ly
C. K. Ogden
