Dear Wittgenstein
I have written to your publisher, praising your book in the highest terms. I hope the letter will reach him. ‒ I wrote to you a few days ago, to your old address, saying that if I can obtain permission I will come to Holland at Christmas for a week to see you ‒ I can't manage sooner or longer, worse luck. I am very thankful you are free ‒ let me have personal news of your health, experiences etc. as soon as it is possible ‒ Warmest good wishes ‒
yours ever
B Russell
