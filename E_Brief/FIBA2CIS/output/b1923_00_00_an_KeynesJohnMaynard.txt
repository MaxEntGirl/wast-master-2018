Text: 
Dear Keynes!
Thanks so much for sending me the "Reconstruction in Europe". I should have preferred though to have got a line from you personally, saying how you are getting on, etc. Or, are you too busy to write letters? I don't supose you are. Do you ever see Johnson? If so, please give him my love. I should so much like to hear from him too (not about my book but about himself).
So do write to me sometime, if you will condescend to do such a thing.
Yours sincerely
Ludwig Wittgenstein
