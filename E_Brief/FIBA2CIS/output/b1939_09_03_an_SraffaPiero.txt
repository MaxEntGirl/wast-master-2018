Sunday 
morning 
Dear Sraffa,
I take it that you’ll by now be in Cambridge. I’ve come here to see Drury. It isn’t a holiday for I’m not very well & what happens now is enough to make a healthy man sick. I enclose a picture which I want you to keep. I have hardly any hope that anything but the worst will happen. If peace is declared on Poland I don’t know what I’ll do. I hope to see you soon in any case.
So long 
Ludwig Wittgenstein
