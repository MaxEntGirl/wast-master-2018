[Poststempel: HASTINGS, 25 MCH 1940]
Monday, Hastings.
I have been having a very nice Easter holiday here with Wittgenstein. I hope very much you are well and are not finding your work a very great strain.
Best wishes.
Francis Skinner
I can endorse every word of Skinner's. Good wishes to you & Mrs Rhees
Ludwig Wittgenstein
