Dear Roland,
Thanks for your letter. I'm sorry I'm late in replying. I don't know of any place near here which I could recommend. But then I'm not well informed. I know that Swansea is congested with evacuees from London & summer guests on top of that. ‒ My health for the last 4 weeks or so has been much better & I'm therefore trying to work hard & make up for the lost time. What I'll do when I have to leave at the beginning of Oct. I don't yet know & I hope events will take the decision out of my hands.
I'm pretty sure that the peace after this war will be more horrible than the war itself. Though, really, that's only true for some people. ‒ I hope you're having a decent rest & your family, too.
Good wishes!
Ludwig
