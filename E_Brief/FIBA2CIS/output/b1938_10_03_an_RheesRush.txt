Dear Rhees,
I have come back yesterday from Dublin. Why I came back sooner than I originally intended I'll explain an other time. I found your 1st chapter here & was disappointed that you had not sent it in. I think it was wrong not to do it & I think you ought still to do it if there is a chance that it might be overlooked that you're a bit late. I have only glanced at a few pages & can't do more at present, but I didn't at all have a bad impression! So why the hell you should wish to be your own examiner I can't see. As I said, there still is a chance of it being accepted I think you ought to send it in.
I hope to see you before long!
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein.
