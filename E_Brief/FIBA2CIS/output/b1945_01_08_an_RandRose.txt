Dear Miss Rand,
I can’t understand your letter. You write you have a chance of getting a grant "for a skill in a phys. laboratory". What’s that mean? Are you now working in a lab? If you want me to recommend you you must at least be able to explain roughly what it’s all about! Write & say clearly what you want.
Yours sincerely 
L. Wittgenstein
