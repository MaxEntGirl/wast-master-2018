Trinity College 
Tuesday 
Dear Sraffa,
I tried to ring up your mother today because I wanted to see her before leaving for Swansea. The maid told me your mother was at the nursing home & had an operation. Would you, if you find time, let me know what it was & how she is. As I don’t know anything about it, I don’t know if she can, & wants to, see visitors. I intend to leave Cambridge on Monday. If I can see your mother, please let me know when.
Yours 
L. Wittgenstein
