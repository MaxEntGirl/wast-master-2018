Dear Norman
This is the little book I promised to send you. It seems to be out of print so I'm sending you my own copy. I wish to say that normally I can't read any printed prayers but that Johnsons' impressed me by being human. Perhaps you'll see what I mean if you read them. As likely as not you won't like them at all. Because you will probably not look at them from the angle from which I see them. (But you might.) If you don't like the book throw it away. Only first cut out the leaf with my dedication. For when I shall become very famous it'll become very valuable as an autograph, & your grandchildren may be able to sell it for a lot of "dough". ‒ I'm back in Cambridge & feeling pretty lousy. God knows what my lectures will be like! Wish me luck! ‒ I wish you lots of luck, too. Smythies sends you his best wishes.
Let me hear from you before long.
Affectionately
Ludwig
