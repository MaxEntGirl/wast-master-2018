Dear Moore,
I had a letter from Malcolm the other day in which, among other things, he told me about a book which is being written about you & in which you too, so he says, are going to write an article. Forgive me, please, for saying that I read all this with a good deal of concern. I fear that you may now be walking at the edge of that cliff at the bottom of which I see lots of scientists & philosophers lying dead, Russell amongst others. My whole object in writing you was to say: may a good spirit be with you & keep you from getting dizzy & falling down.
I wish you'ld do me a favour. Take the poems of Conrad Ferdinand Meyer out of some library (he was a Swiss Poet in the last century) & read a poem "Die Vestalin". It's quite short. Please read it more than once. I hope you will like it & I hope it will tell you exactly what I want to say.
Please remember me to Mrs Moore. I wish you lots of good luck.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
