Dear Norman,
Thanks for your letter of Aug. 12th. Yes, I think I understand why a ship isn't a good place for 'thinking' ‒ I mean, apart from the fact that you're very busy.
Perhaps I ought to feel elated because the war is over. But I'm not. I can't help feeling certain that this peace is only a truce. And the pretence that the complete stamping out of the 'aggressors' of this war will make this world a better place to live in, as a future war could, of course, only be started by them, stinks to high heaven &, in fact, promises a horrid future.
After these cheering thoughts let me tell you that I'm having a fairly good holiday here & that I'm feeling pretty stupid. Perhaps you'll say you've gathered as much from this letter already. ‒ Rhees sends you his kind regards. ‒ I hope you'll soon be demobilized & that then we'll be able to have talks, not just writes. I'm glad you got "Hadshi Murat" & I hope you'll get a lot out of it, because there is a lot in it. I don't know any of the German books you mention but I'm suspicious about them ‒ because of their authors & for other reasons. ‒ As I said: I hope you'll enjoy the Tolstoy. There's a real man; who has a right to write.
I had your mags 3 or 4 days ago & immediately thanked you for them in a letter which I hope you'll receive soon. They're really grand.
So long! Good luck!
Affectionately
Ludwig
