Monday.
Dear Moore,
I was sorry to hear in the Moral Sc. Club on Saturday that you were resigning your Chairmanship. It wasn't really necessary to resign it as I could always have deputized for you whenever you didn't feel inclined or able to come. â€’ I was, as you can imagine, elected chairman after your letter had been read to the Club. I hope this doesn't mean that you aren't going to come to the meetings when your health will again permit it (& some moderately interesting person reads a paper). I should very much like to see you before long if it's all right with you.
Yours
L. Wittgenstein
