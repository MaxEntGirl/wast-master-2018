Dear Moore,
This is only to say that I've found the missing M.S.S.. Miss Anscombe had not just one copy, as I believed, & I found part of a M.S. in my own possession, & together & with the bit you have the three copies are complete. I needn't say I'm glad.
I also wish to say that I enjoyed very much seeing you these last 5 weeks. I think, in a way, more than I used to. I wish you lots of good luck!
Yours
L. Wittgenstein
P.S. I shall give Drury your good wishes. You didn't actually tell me to, but I know it's all right with you.
