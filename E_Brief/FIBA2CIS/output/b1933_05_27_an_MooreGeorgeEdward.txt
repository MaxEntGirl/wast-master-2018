Dear Moore
Enclosed please find the proof of my letter to Mind. I have made no corrections. Please read it through & see whether there is anything to be altered. I wonder whether the comma after "Now" in line 8 is necessary & that after "print". If not I'd rather leave them out. Also the comma after "think" three lines below seems to me not necessary.
Yours ever
Ludwig Wittgenstein
