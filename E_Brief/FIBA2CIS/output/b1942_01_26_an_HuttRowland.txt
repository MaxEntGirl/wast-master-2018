My dear Roland,
Thanks for your note, dated 24 Jan. Better let's wait 3 more months before we try to see each other. ‒ As long as you find it difficult to say that you want to see me, as you write, why should you see me? I want to see people who want to see me; & if the time should come (& perhaps it will come soon) when nobody'll want to see me, I think I'll see nobody.
I wish you good luck, & a good heart, & good & decent thoughts.
So long! ‒
Ludwig
