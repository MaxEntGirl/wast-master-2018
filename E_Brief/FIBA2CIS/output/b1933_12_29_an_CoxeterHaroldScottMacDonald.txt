Text: 
Dear Coxeter,
I very much disapprove of what you have done; particularly of the way you put me before a 'fait accompli', in order to give me no choice. I don't yet know What I am going to do & I shan't decide until I have talked the matter over with a friend in whose judgement I can rely. I want you to know however that I would even go as far as resigning my lectureship if it turned out that as a lecturer I cannt keep my teaching clean, & free from a connection with journalism.
 Yours sincerely
Ludwig Wittgenstein
