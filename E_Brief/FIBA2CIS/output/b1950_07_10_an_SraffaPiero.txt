Dear Sraffa,
Thanks a lot for the 'Antiphones'! I haven’t yet been able to try them out as I had to go to London over the week-end. Here in Oxford the mugginess is almost unberable! I’d like to come to Cambridge in about 10 days, partly because I want to see my doctor before going to Norway. You told me what day you’re leaving Cambridge, but I’m afraid I forgot. I hope you’ll still be up when I arrive. – I haven’t seen any papers for a long time, except headlines, but to the eyes of a layman things look pretty dangerous, as though a war might come soon.
Sorry to write so badly. My hands sometimes won’t obey.
Yours 
Ludwig Wittgenstein
