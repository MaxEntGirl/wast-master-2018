Dear Roy,
I had a letter from you this morning, in which you say that you have no hope of coming back this year. I am very sorry to hear this, both for you & for those who are looking forward to seeing you again. Though why in bl... anyone should wish to see you back here beats me. ‒ You say you haven't heard from me again for some time, but I'm writing pretty regularly. It's the Censor who keeps my letters; & I don't blame him either, because they're so full of wit & wisdom. It must be difficult for him to read one of them & then let it go again. I'm sure he collects them & one day they'll all be published. ‒ The weather here is awful & I feel pretty lousy most of the time. My lectures are going well, so far. What I miss most is someone I can talk nonsense to by the yard. ‒ Let me know your new address soon, so I can write you a Christmas card.
Look after yourself & be good. God bless you!
Ludwig
