Dear Russell,
My address is going to be: L. W. c/o. Halvard Draegni Skjolden, Sogn, Norway. I am not yet there. ‒ Identity is the very Devil! Types have got a good deal clearer to me on the journey. Hope you have got typewriten business all right. I saw Whitehead before going & he was charming as usual. Let me hear from you as soon as possible; I want it badly! Give my love to everybody who wants it. Yrs as long as there is such a thing as
L. W.
P.S. I am not as far north as I thought I would be as the Inn I intended to stay at is closed during the winter.
