Dear Mrs. Sraffa,
Thank you very much for your letter! Believe it or not, I have been thinking for the last month or so of writing to you, or to your son, just to find out how you are getting on. If you hadn’t written to me I think I would have written in about a week. I am very well, & have been most of the time. I am very grateful for this mild winter, though just now it’s pretty cold & snowing heavily. But we have, so far, not had more than two days snow this whole winter. – I don’t know when I shall come to England again, perhaps in spring, but I don’t think so. I think I shall have to come sometime next summer anyhow. I hope to see you then. I hope you will keep well! Thanks again for writing to me.
Yours 
Ludwig Wittgenstein
