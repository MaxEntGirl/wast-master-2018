Text: 
Dear Moore,
Why on earth won't you do your paper here? You shall have a sittingroom with a splendid view all by yourself & I shall leave you allone as much as you like (in fact the whole day, if necessary) on the other hand we could see one another whenever both of us should like to. And we could even talk over your business (which might be fun) Or do you want so many books? You see ‒ I've plenty to do myself, so I shan't disturb you a bit. Do take the Boat that leaves Newcastle on the 17th arriving in Bergen on the 19th & do your work here (I might even have a good influence upon it by preventing too many repetitions) I think, now, that Logic must be very nearly, done if it is not allready. ‒ So, do think over what I've said!!
Yours etc. etc.
L.W.
P.S. Oh ‒ Do buy the "Schicksalslied" by Brahms in an arrangement for 4 hands & bring it with you. And, please, send a telegram if you come on the 19th. I hope you will.
