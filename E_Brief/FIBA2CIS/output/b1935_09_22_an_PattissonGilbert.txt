Sunday
My dear Gilbert!
Tomorrow evening I shall leave Moskow (I am staying in the Rooms which Napoleon had in 1812). The day after tomorrow my boat sails from Leningrad & I can only hope that Neptune will have a heart when he sees me. My boat is due in London on Sunday 29th. Could you either meet the boat or leave a message for me at my Palace (usually called "Strand Palace")? I'm looking forward to seeing your old & bloody face again. Ever in blood.
Ludwig.
P.S. If the Censor reads this it serves him right!
