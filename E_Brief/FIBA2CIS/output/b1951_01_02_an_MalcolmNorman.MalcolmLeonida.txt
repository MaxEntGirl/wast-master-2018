Dear Norman,
Dear Lee,
Thank you very, very much for the wonderful Christmas present. I have the pull-over on right now & am looking very distinguished in it. â€’ I don't know if I wrote to you that when I was in Norway in October I thought of going back there to do some work. I asked a friend there who has a farm could I come back & stay over the winter, or longer. I was told that I could. It would have been a very cheap & very quiet place. I booked a passage on a steamer Newcastle-Bergen on Dec. 30th. Shortly before Christmas I heard that my friend could not put me up after all & at the same time I fell ill & so couldn't have gone anyway. I'm very much better now & I'm waiting for some news from some other people in Norway to whom I wrote, asking them if they knew a suitable place for me. So far I haven't heard from them & I'm not optimistic. I spent Christmas in Cambridge in my doctors house. I'd gone to see him to have an examination before travelling to Norway & I fell ill in his house & had to stay there. Yesterday I came back here & found your lovely present & Xmas card. In Cambridge I read a book which interested me & which I thought was rather well written. It's called "Rommel" by an English Brigadier Young & is a kind of biography of the German general & a history of his exploits. I thought it might be a possible, though very belated, Christmas present & I'm sending it to you. It's possible that you won't like it at all.
All good wishes, as always, & thanks again.
Affectionately
Ludwig
