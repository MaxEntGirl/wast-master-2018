Dear Norman,
Thanks for the detective mags! They are rich in mental vitamines & calories. It was nice getting them from you & also your Xmas card!
I'm in Swansea again over Christmas & probably over New Year. The weather's foul. but I enjoy not being in Cambridge. I know quite a number of people here whom I like. I seem to find it more easy to get along with them here than in England. I feel much more often like smiling, e.g. when I walk in the street, or when I see children, etc. Just now I feel very stupid. I ought to do some work but I don't. Last term my lectures didn't go too bad, on the whole. At the beginning of the term I thought I wouldn't be able to manage them. I felt a queer kind of exhaustion, sometimes coming on suddenly. Then a doctor prescribed me glucose & that helped me enormously & I was pretty fit afterwards.
I'll stop now. This letter's lousy, I know. But it's as good as I can do just now.
Good luck! Be good!
Affectionately
Ludwig
