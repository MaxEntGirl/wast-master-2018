Dear Malcolm,
I haven't heard from you for ages. I'm still at my old work but may possibly leave here soon as my boss is going into the army & the whole research unit may brake up, or get another boss. I am feeling rather lonely here & may try to get to some place where I have someone to talk to. E.g. to Swansea where Rhees is a lecturer in philosophy. I don't know if you remember Rhees. You saw him in my lectures, I believe. He was a pupil of Moore's & is an excellent man & has a real talent for philosophy, too. I haven't seen Smythies for ages, nor heard from him, but someone told me that he has a job at Oxford. (Not at the University.).
I'm in good health but often depressed. ‒ If you feel like writing to me I'ld like to hear from you; but if you don't feel like writing ‒ don't.
Good luck!
Affectionately
Ludwig Wittgenstein
