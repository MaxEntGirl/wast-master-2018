DELEGAZIONE ITALIANA
AL CONGRESSO DELLA PACE
HOTEL EDOUARD VII
PARIGI, 13 May 1919
My dear Wittgenstein,
Russell has sent me a letter of yours showing that you are a prisoner of war in Italy and have the manuscript of your book with you; â€’ but have no safe way of dealing with it. Perhaps this is all out of date by now. But in case it is not, I am begging the Italian authorities to do all that is possible in the circumstances and to provide an absolutely safe way of conveying the MS. or other communications to Russell through me. I much hope that it may also be possible to arrange some relaxation of the usual provisions.
I should immensely like to see you again.
Yours ever
JM Keynes
