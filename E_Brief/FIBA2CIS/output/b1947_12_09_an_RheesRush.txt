Dear Rhees,
Today I arrived at the above address & am feeling still very strange, cold & uncomfortable. I hope I'll get acclimatized. It's a little guesthouse, the only guest is me, it's about 3 hours by bus from Dublin. I came here because in spite of looking around for 2 weeks I could find nothing else that would do at all. I may, in a couple of months, move to a much more isolated place in the west of Ireland. I can't, so far, say anything about my work ‒ or about anything else for that matter. Wish me luck! ‒ & the same to you!
Please give all my good wishes to Mrs Rhees.
I shan't come to England at Christmas, unless there are most unexpected developements ‒ I havent seen a newspaper for ages. I don't think I've lost much.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
