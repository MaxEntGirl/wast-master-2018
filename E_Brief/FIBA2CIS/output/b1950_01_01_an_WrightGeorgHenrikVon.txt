Dear v. Wright,
First I'd like to say that my health isn't too bad at all. Unfortunately I caught a cold some days ago, but it's gradually getting better. The main reason I'm writing is this: I have an idea that last summer, before leaving for America, I gave you a book to read, the letters of Wilhelm Busch to a Frau Marie Anderson. I wanted to lend you the book & to give it as a Christmas present to Rhees. I forgot to ask you about it before I left. Please, if you can, look for it in your room, etc, & if you find it, please send it to Rhees with a note. If you still have some Christmas paper around I'd be grateful if you rapped it in that. I'm sorry to trouble you with it. â€’ I hope you're all well by now! & that you had a pleasant Christmas. Please give your wife my kindest regards & to Eva also.
Yours ever
Ludwig Wittgenstein
Happy New Year!
P.S. Rhees's Address
is 96 Bryn Rd.
Swansea
