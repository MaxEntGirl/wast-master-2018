Dear Rhees,
Thanks for your kind letter. In answer I only wish to say that, as you often have experienced, I'm more dependent on my friends than anyone I've ever known. ‒ I feel better here now than I did when I arrived. I'm more accustomed to the people & they to me, the weather's warmer & I'm in better health. My work which had stopped completely for a few days ‒ partly because of intestinal trouble, partly because of general dullness ‒ is stirring again a little. May it continue!! I'm enclosing a Christmas card. I know you don't care for them but I like to send them.
I, too, hope to see you before long; perhaps round about Easter.
Give my good wishes to Mrs Rhees & also to the old lady on the ground floor in 104 Goldhurst Terr.
Good wishes, as always!
L. Wittgenstein
To Wish You
a Happy Christmas
MAY THE NEW YEAR
BRING TO YOU MANY
BRIGHT AND
HAPPY DAYS
 
from
Ludwig Wittgenstein
