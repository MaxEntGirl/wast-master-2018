TRINITY COLL. CAMB.

Dear v. Wright,
Thank you very much for your letter. It meant a great deal to me to have you in Cambridge for a term. I, too, wish it had been for longer. I've been to Ireland & I intend to go to Vienna on Sept. 10th & to return to England about Oct. 7th. I believe that I'll then resign my professorship & go somewhere where I can be alone for a longish time in order to think &, if possible, to finish a part of my book. I thought of going to Norway for that purpose but may go to Ireland instead. I'm not sure. I haven't told the Cambridge authorities anything about it so far, as it's not yet absolutely certain. (Though just now I can't see how it can be avoided, I mean, my leaving Cambridge.) My mind just now is in great disorder. It's partly due to this, that I dread seeing Vienna again after all that's happened &, in a way, I also dread chucking my job at Cambridge. But I'll get over it. May I see you again some day!! I wish you all good luck for your outer life, but by far more for your inner life; & I wish myself the same. My case is much more hopeless, I feel, than yours. â€’ I like to think of our time at Cambridge. Let me remain in contact with you.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
