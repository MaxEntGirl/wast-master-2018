Dear Roland,
Thanks for your letter. As to coming to see me here: follow your own feeling. You've known me for years & I haven't changed much & you haven't always cared for me a lot. If you want to come in spite of this you'll be welcome. If you think you'd better not I shan't be hurt. In case you come let me know well in advance if possible that & when you're coming.
You have all my good wishes as always,
Ludwig
