Text: 
Dear Sraffa, 
I expected you on Sunday. When you hadn’t turned up till 6 I thought of looking into your room to see what was the matter but I didn’t feel very well myself & so stayed at home. – I wrote a long letter 10 pages in answer to yours which I got on Saturday. I wrote it in pencil & so badly that you couldn’t read it; also parts are only sketched. If I can I’ll write it out properly (or dictate it). Just now I can’t as I’m not well (nerves & bladder).
I’m afraid I cann’t see you next Sunday as someone is coming to visit me. But Sunday March 11th would do me. Shall I come to your room?
Yours,
Ludwig Wittgenstein
