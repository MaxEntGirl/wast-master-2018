Dear Miss Rand,
I can’t write to these people recommending you unless they ask me to write to them. So you can ||in this, or in similar cases|| give them my name as reference, & if they want my opinion they’ll ask for it. Anyhow, I can say very little that can interest them. Whether there is any chance of your being any good as a lab. assistant I don’t know at all. In fact, I doubt it; though this I wouldn’t tell them.
Yours sincerely 
L. Wittgenstein
