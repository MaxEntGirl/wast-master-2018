Text: 
Dear Sraffa, 
When we last met I said that I was going to call on you sometime, & I want to explain why I haven’t done so yet. I have just now very little or practically no power to spare, my work takes up what I have. Now you know that the conversations which we had in recent times (meaning roughly the last 6 or 9 months) were always a very great strain for me; & I’m sure for you too. This in itself wouldn’t matter but I think it is clear that, for the present at any rate, we have given each other all that we can give. I have learnt an enormous amount from you in the conversations we had during the past 2 or 3 years; but I can’t say that I have learnt much from you in our last conversations. Not that I’ve learnt all you can teach! But I’ve learnt most of what at present can be assimilated by me. That’s why our last conversations haven’t been profitable. Now this, I think, is no ground for never meeting again; but it is the reason why, until I feel more powerful, I avoid having a conversation with you.
Yours,
Ludwig Wittgenstein
