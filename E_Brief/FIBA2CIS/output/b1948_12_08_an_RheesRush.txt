Dear Rhees,
Thanks for your letter of Nov. 28th. I'm delighted to hear that you're thinking of coming & so, by the way, is Drury. ‒ Please let me know as soon as you can what day you're arriving, & eventually also what time. ‒ I can still work moderately well & that, on the whole, makes me feel well (better than my work is): I'll probably not be much good at discussion, but I hope that won't deterr? you.
I shan't write more today as I hope I'll soon be able to say it.
As always,
Ludwig Wittgenstein
