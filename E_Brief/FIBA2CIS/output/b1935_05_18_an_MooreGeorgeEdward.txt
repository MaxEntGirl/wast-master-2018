Dear Moore,
I am returning Miss Ambrose's M.S. ‒ After her conversation with you on Thursday she wrote me a letter in which she gave me cheek. ‒ I didn't answer it, only sent it back to her with the remark: 'Don't destroy this letter, it may interest you some day to reread it'. ‒ I think you have no idea in what a serious situation she is. I don't mean serious, because of the difficulty to find a job; but serious because she is now actually standing at a crossroad. One road leading to perpetual misjudging of her intellectual powers and thereby to hurt pride and vanity etc. etc. The other would lead her to a knowledge of her own capacities and that always has good consequences. ‒ You are the only person who now has any influence on her and I wish you'ld use it for a good end! ‒ I have given up the idea to talk to Newman. I think the right thing for me is not to have my hand in this matter any more. Whether I shall write to 'Mind' or not I don't yet know.
Yours ever
Ludwig Wittgenstein
