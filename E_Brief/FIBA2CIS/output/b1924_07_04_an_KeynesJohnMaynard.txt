Text: 
My dear Keynes!
Thanks awfully for your books & for your letter dated.... Please excuse me for answering so late. Why I put off writing to you so long was because I was afraid and am still afraid I should not be able to make myself understood to you in english and if I write in german allthough the business doesn't become hopeless at this End in this case allready you might not find anybody to translate my letter. But now I thought I would have to try after all to write in English. Well: It was very kind indeed of you to invite me to stay in England during the summer. Now the absolute truth about the matter is this: 1) I should like very much to see you again: on the other hand 2) I'm afraid I shall probably disappoint you because I have changed so much since we met last. Especially I am no longer capable to do any good
