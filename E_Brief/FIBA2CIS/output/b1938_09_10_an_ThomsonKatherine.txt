Dear Mrs Thomson,
This is only to say how much I enjoyed hearing you play last night. It did me good to hear that you really meant what you said – as it were. I know nothing about technique, of course, (& yours may be pretty poor, for all I know) but it sounded lovely to hear you play the wonderful accompaniments.
Good wishes.
Yours sincerely
Ludwig Wittgenstein
