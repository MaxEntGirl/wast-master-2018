Dear Roland,
Thanks for your letter & the detective story. If your interview with the Education Corps committee has any positive result, let me know. If your work now is more interesting than in the ward I hope you'll keep it, & shan't lose it by some negligence or other. I am very sorry to hear that you & Lotte don't get on well with your mother. This war, I believe, has a bad effect on all of us. (It also seems to be gradually killing me, although I'm in good health.) I hope I shall be able to see you during the Christmas vac. Probably not before, because I'm very busy.
Drury, as you know, is in France. I'm afraid I havent heard from him for almost 3 weeks. He was or is in a big hospital. His address, in case you want to write to him, is:101287 Capt M.O'C. D.
R.A.M.C., N°6 British General Hospital
B.L.A.
I hope you can make your relation to your mother more satisfactory! Good wishes!
Ludwig
