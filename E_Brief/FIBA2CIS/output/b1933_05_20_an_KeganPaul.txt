Dear Sirs,
In reply to your letter dated May 18th I am sorry to say I have forgotten what Mr Ramsey’s corrections were & I should like to see them before the second edition goes into print. I certainly don’t wish to make any further alterations.
There is another thing about which I wish to write to you. I don’t know what demand there is for my book but from the fact that you are preparing a second edition and other indications I gather that it now sells fairily well. If I remember the terms of our aggreement all rights to the book where then assigned to you. But I wonder if under the circumstances you would not think it equitable to allow me a royalty on the second edition (& future editions if any). My reason for this suggestion as you will have understood, is that although I consider our original aggreement to have been perfectly fair since you were taking a considerable risk in publishing the book, it is now quite clear that the book is earning a profit. 
I hope this suggestion will not strike you as improper.
