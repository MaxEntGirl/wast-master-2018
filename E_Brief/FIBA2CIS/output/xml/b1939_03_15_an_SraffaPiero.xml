If my impression was correct (or pretty nearly correct) I should like you to <hi rend="underline">confirm</hi> it.</p> <p rend="indent">As to the quotation from Spengler I wish to say that, although it doesn’t seem to me to matter in the least that you get nothing out of it, it does seem to me important that when I told you the quotation you reacted to it with a smile (of a particular sort). I must confess again that I don’t like this phenomenon at all. It is, of course, the attitude of <hi rend="underline">contempt</hi> for what you don’t understand (an attitude you have denounced more than once in our conversations). I <hi rend="underline">believe</hi> I know how excellent &amp; sound your understanding is, as far as it goes; but I believe that it is very narrowly bounded, &amp; I can’t help believing that you have no idea of how narrowly bounded it is.</p> <p rend="indent">I <hi rend="underline">must</hi> say also that this in no way detracts for my respect (etc.) for you. In fact, if I had not as much of these feelings toward you as I have I would not take the matter so seriously. I hope this doesn’t sound as though it were meant as an advice from a wiser man to one less <hi rend="underline">wise</hi>. (You know what I think of myself.)</p> <p rend="indent">I wish you a good luck, in every way!</p> <p rend="indent">Yours </p> <p rend="indent">Ludwig Wittgenstein </p> </div> <div type="postscript" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"> <p rend="indent">P.S.
