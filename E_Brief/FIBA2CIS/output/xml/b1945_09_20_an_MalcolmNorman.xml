I'm glad to hear that you're going to get out of the Navy before long &amp; I hope you'll come to Cambridge before I make up my mind to resign the absurd job of a prof. of philosophy. It is a kind of living death. ‒ I'm going back to it in a fortnight. ‒</p> <p rend="indent">I once tried to read 'Resurection' but couldn't. You see, when Tolstoy just tells a story he impresses me infinitely more than when he addresses the reader. When he turns his back to the reader then he seems to me <hi rend="underline">most</hi> impressive. Perhaps one day we can talk about this. It seems to me his philosophy is most true when its <hi rend="underline">latent</hi> in the story. Talking of philosophy: my book is gradually nearing its final form, &amp; if you're a good boy &amp; come to Cambridge I'll let you read it. It'll probably disappoint you. And the truth is: it's pretty lousy. (Not that I could improve on it essentially if I tried for another 100 years.) This, however, doesn't worry me. What I hear about Germany &amp; Austria does. The re-educators of the Germans are doing nicely. Pity there won't be many left to enjoy the fruit of re-education.</p> <p rend="indent">My landlord has a modern American translation of the Bible. I dislike the translation of the N.T. (by a man E. J. Goodspeed) but the translation of the O.T. (by a group of people) makes a lot of things clearer to me &amp; seems to me <hi rend="underline">well</hi> worth reading. Perhaps you'll see it one day.</p> <p rend="indent">So long! Look after yourself!</p> <p rend="indent">Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
