The work is just what I wanted. I believe I am doing it quite well. I work from about 8.30 to about 4.30 or 5 &amp; feel <hi rend="underline">extremely</hi> tired when it’s over. The chap (20 years old) who’s in charge of me &amp; shows me what to do I find an excellent teacher; we work well together &amp; without any friction. My work, apart from carrying medicines &amp; bandages etc around, consists in mixing ointments &amp; the like. When the day’s work is done I have practically no strength left at all to <hi rend="underline">think</hi> about anything. If my health will stick it &amp; I get a little stronger bodily this <hi rend="underline">may</hi> change. My quarters are with the doctors (address above), my room’s comfortable, but only moderately quiet. – Ryle is very nice to me. The other doctors I’ve seen so far seem stiff &amp; unattractive. All the working people I met, I liked. </p> <p rend="indent">The one serious &amp; <hi rend="underline">bad</hi> business is that I have bad nights. In spite (or perhaps because) of my great tiredness I sleep badly &amp; that has an accumulative bad effect, &amp; I have to take phanodorm, which I hate.</p> <p rend="indent">You once said I should write if I wanted you to send me anything. I’m now making use of this offer. Please go to Coulson, the chemist, &amp; buy a tin of Sedin (if possible a large one) for me (it’s 6/6). He probably has reserved one for me so please tell him it’s for me. I’ll settle with you when I come to Cambridge.</p> <p rend="indent">Give your mother all my very best wishes. If I come to Cambridge in the weekend after next I’ll try to see you.</p> <p rend="indent">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div> </div></body></text></TEI>
