(That's all I know)</p> <p>My dear Norman,</p> <p rend="indent">Thanks for your letter of Feb. 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. As you see I'm in Cambridge; I'm staying with my doctor who is an extremely kind man &amp; an excellent doctor. I also saw a speciallist here &amp; I'm to have deep X-ray treatment again, this time for my spine. I've had a pretty bad time at Oxford but am feeling much better now (for reasons no one knows), I have very little pain &amp; discomfort. ‒ Yes, the Bouwsmas were <hi rend="underline">angelic</hi>, &amp; so was Miss Anscombe. I'm not sure how long I shall stay here. It'll depend on how things go. ‒ I believe I wrote to you that before I fell ill I intended to go to Norway to <hi rend="doubleunderline">try</hi> to work there. I'd even taken a ticket to Bergen. I don't know if I'll ever get well enough to do this; probably not. In this case I shall probably go back to Oxford from here. I can't even <hi rend="underline">think</hi> of work at present, &amp; it doesn't matter, if only I don't live too long! I'm not depressed though. von Wright came to see me twice. If he knew I was writing to you he'd send you his very best wishes &amp; so would Smythies &amp; Miss Anscombe.</p> <p rend="indent">I wish I could have a talk again with you, Doney &amp; Nelson. But even if I could be with you you'd find that my head was empty. (It was half empty already when I was in Ithaca.) Please give my kind regards to D. &amp; N. &amp; to D<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Mooney. I like to think of her &amp; I always praise her when I talk of her. ‒ Give my love to L. &amp; R. &amp; C..</p> <p rend="indent">As always, affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
