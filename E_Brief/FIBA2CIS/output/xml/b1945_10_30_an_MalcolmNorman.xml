I'm glad you had a good holiday &amp; glad that you plan coming here next year. Well, I'll try to be here then. My job is a very, very dubious one for a dozen different reasons. ‒ My class just now is fairly large, 19 people. Many of them will drop off, of course, &amp; I wish this process could be accelerated. ‒ Smythies is coming &amp; a woman who's very good, i.e., <hi rend="underline">more</hi> than just <hi rend="underline">intelligent</hi>. There is also an Indian (or, at least, he is dark) who seems to be all right; also two American soldiers: one's a dud, the other's nice but I don't think he knows what we're talking about. ‒ If you'll read my book you'll have to read German. May be if I find a nice German book I'll send it to you to brush up your German. ‒ I see Moore about once every 3 weeks. He's in very good health. Smythies is very overworked &amp; looks pale &amp; very thin, I'm sorry to say.</p> <p rend="indent">Be good! &amp; think decent &amp; intelligent thoughts. And not just about logic &amp; philosophy etc!</p> <p rend="indent">I'm looking forward very much to the mental nourishment you've promised me. If I read your mags I often wonder how anyone can read 'Mind' with all it's impotence &amp; bankruptcy when they could read Street &amp; Smyth mags. Well, everyone to his taste. ‒ Good luck!</p> <p rend="indent">Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
