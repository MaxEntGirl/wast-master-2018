"The meaning of meaning" reached me a few days ago. The "other things" you mention must have got lost, except Keynes's edition of the Manchester Guardian. In the last month I have not been quite well, my nerves being run down badly by much work and excitement. This is the reason why I have not yet been able to read your book thoroughly. I have however read in it and I think I ought to confess to you frankly that I believe you have not quite <hi rend="underline">caught the problems</hi> which ‒ for instance ‒ I was at in my book (whether or not I have given the correct solution). ‒ My present address is precisely the one you wrote to:</p> <p rend="indent">Puchberg am Schneeberg. Nieder-Österreich.</p> <p rend="indent">I should love to hear from Ritchie.</p> <p rend="indent">Please excuse my remark about your book. I did not make it because I thought that you were interested in my opinion about it, but mearely for the sake of frankness.</p> <p rend="indent">I hope you can read this letter. I'm sure there are more faults in it than words.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours sincerely</p> <p rend="right">L. Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
