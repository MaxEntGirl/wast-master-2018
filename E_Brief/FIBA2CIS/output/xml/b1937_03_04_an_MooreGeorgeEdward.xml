Partly because I've been troubled about myself a lot. In the last few days I've been able to work a bit better, but still only very moderately. The days are getting longer now &amp; that cheers me up, but I still don't see the sun from where I live (Though in the village it shines for many hours.)</p> <p rend="indent">Give my love to Wisdom &amp; tell him, please, to write to me occasionally. Have you heard from Rees? I suppose you haven't seen Skinner, or I would have heard it from him. Though I wish you had! ‒</p> <p rend="indent">I enclose two stamps which might be of use to Mrs Moore. Please remember me to her. I hope to hear from you soon.</p> <p rend="indent">Lots of good wishes!</p> <p rend="indent">Yours</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
