I wonder how you like being an elementary school-teacher &amp; how you get on with the boys ‒ It is honest work, perhaps as honest as there is, &amp; everybody now-a-days is engaged in some form of humbug, which you escape from.</p> <p rend="indent">I like China &amp; the Chinese ‒ They are lazy, good-natured, fond of laughter, very like nice children ‒ They are very kind &amp; nice to me. All the nations set upon them &amp; say they mustn't be allowed to enjoy life in their own way ‒ They will be forced to develop an army &amp; navy, to dig up their coal &amp; smelt their iron, whereas what they want to do is to make verses &amp; paint pictures (very beautiful) &amp; make strange music, exquisite but almost inaudible, on many-stringed instruments with green tassels. Miss Black &amp; I live in a Chinese house, built round a courtyard; I send you a picture of me at the door of my study. My students are all Bolsheviks, because that is the fashion; they are annoyed with me for not being more of a Bolshevik myself. They are not advanced enough for mathematical logic; I lecture to them on Psychology, Philosophy, Politics &amp; Einstein. Once in a way I have them to an evening party &amp; they let off fire-works in the courtyard ‒ They like this better than lectures. ‒ I leave China in July, spend a month in Japan, &amp; then come back to London ‒ 70 Overstrand Mansions, S. W. 11, will always find me.</p> <p rend="indent">Miss Black sends all sorts of messages ‒ Best love, my dear Ludwig ‒ I shall hope to see you again, perhaps next year ‒ I suppose by then it will be possible to travel to Trattenbach ‒ Be as happy as you can!</p> <p rend="indent">Ever yours affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Bertrand Russell.</p> </div> </div></body></text></TEI>
