I moved to Cambridge about a month ago because D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bevan (with whom I'm staying) advised me to get some deep x-ray treatment at Addenbrookes. I have now much less pain than I had during the really bad time at Oxford. This isn't all due to the treatment though, for the pain had already decreased before I came here, &amp; if it hadn't I couldn't have travelled. The doctor who supervises the treatment, Prof. Mitchell, is a cancer speciallist with a lot of experience &amp; also intelligence ("an excellent thing in doctors"). I'm up every day a bit &amp; often the whole day. I'm very weak physically &amp; mentally &amp; have all sorts of discomforts but <hi rend="underline">very</hi> little pain. ‒ I should <hi rend="underline">very</hi> much like to see you around April 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. I don't know yet where I shall be then. Whether here or in Oxford. We can arrange details of place &amp; time later. ‒ The weather here is terrible: cold, windy &amp; weat. I see very little of it because I'm in doors the whole time except when I go to the hospital by taxi. A fortnight ago, when I felt particularly well for a bit, I walked from Addenbrookes to Great St. Mary's. Perhaps when you come I'll have another good spell. ‒ I read a good deal &amp; not only detective stories.</p> <p rend="indent">I'm looking forward to seeing you. This letter is damn stupid, but what will you ‒</p> <p rend="indent">I hope you'll have some good weather for walks &amp; altogether some good luck in various respects.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
