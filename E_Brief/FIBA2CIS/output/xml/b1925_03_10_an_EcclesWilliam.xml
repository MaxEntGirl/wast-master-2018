For some reason or other I was convinced that you either were killed in the war or, if alive, that you would hate Germans &amp; Austrians so much that you would have no more intercourse with me. This seems extraordinary because my Cambridge friends are still writing to me &amp; I to them, and the book which ‒ as you perhaps remember ‒ I started writing before the war, was published three or four years ago in England. (It's called "Tractatus logico-philosophicus“ and has been printed by Trench, Trubner &amp; Co. London). This shows you that I'm alive. About the various events of my life I will not write now (I would have to write a book) except that at present I am elementary school teacher in the place you addressed your letter to. I am <hi rend="underline">awfully</hi> anxious to hear from you &amp; <hi rend="underline">all</hi> about you. Are Dr &amp; Mrs Moore still alive? If so, please remember me to them and in fact to everybody who doesn't mind remembering me. I wish I could see you again before long. But when &amp; where we can meet God knows. Perhaps we might manage to meet during the summer vacation, but I haven't got much time and <hi rend="underline">no</hi> money to come to England as I have given away <hi rend="underline">all</hi> my money about 6 years ago. Last summer I should have come to England to see a friend of mine Mr Keynes (whose name you may know) in Cambridge. He would have paid my expenses, but I resolved after all not to come, because I was so much afraid that the long time and the great events (external &amp; <hi rend="underline">internal</hi>) that ly between us would prevent us from understanding one another. However now ‒ or at least <hi rend="underline">today</hi> ‒ I feel as if I might still be able to make myself understood to my old friends and if I get any oportunity, I might ‒ w.w.p. ‒ come and see you at Manchester.</p> <p rend="indent">In any case please write to me soon &amp; long. Please excuse my faulty English; I haven't even got a dictionary to look up words &amp; correct the spelling.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours ever</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> <p rend="indent">Otterthal Post Kirchberg am Wechsel</p> <p rend="indent">Nieder-Österreich</p> <p rend="indent">Austria</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
