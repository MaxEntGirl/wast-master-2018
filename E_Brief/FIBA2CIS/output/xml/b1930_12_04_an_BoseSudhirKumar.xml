However today I did. I have not been exceedingly well this term having colds &amp; influenza. But now I've had my last lecture thank God and shall go down (to Vienna) in 3 days. Before I go down however something agreeable is going to happen to me: I'm going to be made a Fellow of Trinity the day after tomorrow. This, as you will imagine, is very gratifying to me. I hope you are well &amp; getting on allright. Let me know something about you soon.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
