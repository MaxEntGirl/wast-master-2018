I do believe that it <hi rend="underline">was</hi> the right thing for me to come here thank God. I can't imagine that I could have worked anywhere as I do here. It's the quiet &amp;, perhaps, the <hi rend="underline">wonderful</hi> scenery; I mean, its quiet seriousness.</p> <p rend="indent">I am sorry to hear that your work hasn't been going well, or satisfactorily. I'm sure somehow that you're doing good work, &amp; at the same time I think I can understand, why you don't get "anything finally written". That, I think, shows that what you're doing is right. I don't mean that it would be wrong however if you got anything finally written &amp; in fact I hope you <hi rend="underline">will</hi>.</p> <p rend="indent">Rhees' case is, of course, quite different, but here too I can't help feeling that it's not bad, <hi rend="underline">in fact that it's good that he found himself unable to write anything</hi>. Please, if you see him, remember me to him &amp; tell him that I was glad to hear that he could not get anything written. That's a <hi rend="underline">good</hi> sign. One can't drink wine while it ferments, but that it's fermenting shows that it isn't dish-water. You see, I still make beautifull similes. ‒ Tell Rhees that I'm not glad because I'm malicious.</p> <p rend="indent">We have had the most wonderfull weather for the last 4 weeks, though it's already getting cold. The waterfalls are entirely frozen &amp; it's about -3°C. at nights. But I don't suffer from the cold as I would in England, for it's dry.</p> <p rend="indent">Remember me to Mrs Moore &amp; to Hardy &amp; Littlewood if you should see them.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
