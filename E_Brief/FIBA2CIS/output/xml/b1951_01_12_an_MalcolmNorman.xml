Both of them are <hi rend="underline">very</hi> good. ‒ Yesterday a M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gilpatrick from the Rockefeller Foundation visited me. I told him what I wrote to you some months ago, i.e., that in my present state of health &amp; intellectual dullness I couldn't accept a grant; but I said that if, against all probability &amp; hope, I should one day find that I could again do worthwhile work in philosophy, I'd write to him. And so we parted on friendly terms. ‒ The Bouwsmas are enormously kind to me. I am ever so glad that he can have discussions with Smythies &amp; Miss A.. Otherwise this place is a philosophical desert; &amp; I am just good enough to eat applesauce with a philosopher. My mind's completely dead. This isn't a complaint, for I don't really suffer from it. I know that life must have an end once &amp; that mental life can cease before the rest does. ‒ Your pull-over is wonderful &amp; fits me perfectly.</p> <p rend="indent">Give my love to Lee, &amp; Good Luck to Ray.</p> <p rend="indent">Thanks for all your kindness.</p> <p rend="indent">Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> <p rend="indent">From Bouwsma &amp; Gilpatrick I heard that you gave a good paper at Toronto.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
