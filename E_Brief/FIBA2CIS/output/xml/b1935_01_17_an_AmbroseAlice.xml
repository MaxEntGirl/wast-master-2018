I say, bring some work along, because reading my german M.S. isn't quite the right thing; it's only a makeshift, for you can't properly understand it without spending lots of time on it, &amp; also the thought that you are reading it &amp; puzzled by it makes me feel sort of nervous when I sit there. If I have proposed something which you don't quite like, please don't do it <hi rend="underline">for me</hi>. On the other hand, if you like doing it this way I should be very pleased.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours very sincerely</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> <p rend="indent">P.S. This signature is worth Â£ 100.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
