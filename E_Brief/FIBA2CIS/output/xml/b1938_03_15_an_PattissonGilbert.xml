As you can imagine I have been, and am, greatly troubled by the events. My relatives so far as I can judge are in no sort of danger as almost all of them are retiring and very respected people. My brother and sisters are, under the new laws, Jews, (not however their children, as they had no Jewish grandparents and baptized great-grandparents). Nevertheless, of course, the new regime [is|must be] <hi rend="underline">hateful</hi> to them. I havenot yet heard from home at all since the invasion, but there hasn't yet been time, and my people would always try to give me news in the <hi rend="underline">mildest possible</hi> form so as not to worry me. I have written home saying that I would come any time if they needed me, but I almost assume that they have no need for me (not that they wouldn't like to see me). Now it is about myself that I really want to write. //there is an arrow which indicates that this sentence is to be moved to this spot!// I am placed in a queer position. As you know I am automatically becoming a German Citizen, i.e. a German Jew. The very thought of becoming a German citizen is appalling to me, <hi rend="underline">even apart</hi> from the degrading position etc., this latter I share with my relatives and could, <hi rend="underline">I think</hi>, bring myself to bear. Though I don't know whether it [may|would] not continuously be preying on my mind. A still graver consequence however is this that on visiting Austria I shall, in all likelihood, not be let [out|back] to England again. You understand of course that it is out of the question for me to get any job there but even if it <hi rend="underline">were</hi> possible I could hardly face [such a possibility|this idea]. You may call this weakness but such it is. My people are wealthyish and will probably even after all the changes have money enough to keep me. But I needn't say what that would mean for me. [So I am now|Therefore now I have been] seriously considering the idea of acquiring British citizenship. You know that I had just <hi rend="underline">thought</hi> of this possibility before though never giving it any serious consideration for reasons which you and I have talked about. They roughly are, that I don't wish to become a sham-Englishman. The situation has however changed in my eyes now as I have to choose between a new [nationality|citizenship] which deprives me of <hi rend="underline">everything</hi> and one which at least gives me the opportunity of working in a country in which I have lived most of my adult life have friends and have done my best work. I wish to God that there did not adhere to British [nationality| citizenship] the respectability etc. etc. which (though it does not repel me) is <hi rend="underline">not</hi> what I seek. But this can't be helped. There is one enormously strong reason which would for me speak against acquiring a new nationality and it is this, that in all likelihood as a British citizen I shall be barred by the Germans from reentering Austria and therefore from seeing my family, except by meeting them, say, in Switzerland. But I don't see at present that this would be worse for me or them than my rotting alive in Austria or being haunted by a false position and anxiety in England. [I am therefore|For these reasons I am] [considering trying to acquire British citizenship <hi rend="underline">seriously</hi>|seriously considering trying to acquire British citizenship]. It may of course be that before even this comes about I shall be summoned home by a letter from my people (in which case I [would|shall] go) but I have no reason to believe this; they would never dream of calling me unless in the <hi rend="underline">greatest</hi> emergency.</p> <p rend="indent">As you can imagine many Cabinet meetings have been held in my mind about these matters, but I also wish to talk them over with you — level-headedly. I should like therefore to come to England in 12 days time i.e. on the ... if you can possibly save the weekend for me. You might, just to make discussion easier, make <hi rend="underline">some</hi> enquiries about the proceedings of nationalisation — unless, that is, you are in my case <hi rend="underline">dead against it</hi>. Please let me know <hi rend="underline">as soon as possible</hi> if, where and when you can meet me. Forgive me for making you read this long letter please don't throw it away and read it [again|once more] if you can. Whatever you may think about my problem I am </p> <p rend="indent">always yours </p> <p rend="indent">bloodily </p> <p rend="indent">L. </p> </div> <div type="postscript" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"> <p rend="indent">In case I should acquire British citizenship I have thought of living not in England but, say, in Ireland where I am more obviously a refugee. That is if I can get work there. (I know I need not tell you that what I want is not <hi rend="underline">just shelter</hi>, but the possibility to work for others.) </p> </div> </div></body></text></TEI>
