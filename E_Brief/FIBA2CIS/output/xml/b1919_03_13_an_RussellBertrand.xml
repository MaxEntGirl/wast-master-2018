I've had a <hi rend="underline">very</hi> bad time, not knowing wether you were dead or alive! I cann't write on Logic as I'm not allowed to write more than two p.cs. a week (15 lines each). This letter is an ecception, it's posted by an austrian medical student who goes home tomorrow. I've written a book called "Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung" containing all my work of the last 6 years. I believe I've solved our problems finally. This may sound arrogant but I cann't help believing it. I finished the book in August 1918 &amp; two month after was made Prigioniere. I've got the manuscript here with me. I wish I could copy it out for you; but it's pretty long &amp; I would have no safe way of sending it to you. In fact you would not understand it without a previous explanation as it's written in quite short remarks. (This of cours means that <hi rend="underline">nobody</hi> will understand it; allthough I believe, it's all as clear as crystall. But it upsets all our theory of truth, of classes, of numbers &amp; all the rest) I will publish it as soon as I get home. Now I'm affraid this <hi rend="underline">won't</hi> be "before long". And consequently it will be a long time yet till we can meet. I can hardly imagine seeing you again! It will be too much! I supose it would be impossible for you to come and see me here? Or perhaps you think it's colossal cheek of me even to think of such a thing. But if you were on the other end of the world &amp; I <hi rend="underline">could</hi> come to you I would do it.</p> <p rend="indent">Please write to me how you are, remember me to Dr Whitehead. Is old Johnson still alive? Think of me often!</p> <p rend="indent">Ever yours</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> <p rend="indent">13.3.19.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
