It seems to be out of print so I'm sending you my own copy. I wish to say that normally I can't read any printed prayers but that Johnsons' impressed me by being <hi rend="underline">human</hi>. Perhaps you'll see what I mean if you read them. As likely as not you won't like them <hi rend="underline">at all</hi>. Because you will probably not look at them from the <hi rend="underline">angle</hi> from which I see them. (But you might.) If you don't like the book throw it away. Only first cut out the leaf with my dedication. For when I shall become <hi rend="underline">very</hi> famous it'll become very valuable as an autograph, &amp; your grandchildren may be able to sell it for a lot of "dough". ‒ I'm back in Cambridge &amp; feeling pretty lousy. God knows what my lectures will be like! Wish me luck! ‒ I wish you lots of luck, too. Smythies sends you his best wishes.</p> <p rend="indent">Let me hear from you before long.</p> <p rend="indent">Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
