I have booked a passage to New York on the Queen Mary for July 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>, &amp; if my health &amp; other circumstances permit it I will come &amp; be a d.... nuisance to you &amp; Lee for 2 or 3 months. May everything go well. ‒ I can't use your letter as an affidavid; its a <hi rend="underline">much</hi> more formal affair than you imagine. I enclose a cutting from the regulations &amp; a form of affidavid. I know that all this red tape is hellish but we can't change it; so please read the damn thing through carefully &amp; comply with all the requirements. There is one more thing I want to say: In this life one doesn't know what's going to happen; &amp; so, supposing later on you were inclined, <hi rend="underline">for whatever reason</hi>, to change your mind about the desirability of my visit, please <hi rend="underline">don't hesitate</hi> to tell me so. I'm told that I can have <hi rend="underline">all</hi> my money for the ticket refunded (except 10 s, which is nothing). ‒ I haven't been doing any work at all for the last 2-3 weeks. My mind is tired &amp; stale, partly, I think because I'm a bit exhausted, partly because lots of things worry me terribly just now. I think I could still discuss philosophy if I had someone here to discuss it with, but alone I can't concentrate on it. I suppose it'll all change some day. The sooner the better. ‒ Well then, please send me that affidavid &amp; prepare yourself for the shock of seeing me. I'm looking forward to seeing you &amp; Lee &amp; Ray again. Give my love to Lee.</p> <p rend="indent">Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
