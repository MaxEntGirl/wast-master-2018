If all that's wrong with him is that he looks like Norman, I dare say he'll live that down. May everything go smoothly with him &amp; you &amp; Ray!! ‒ The Rockefeller people didn't write to me, &amp; I don't see that they had any reason; I never wrote to them. Nor could I ever see why they should give me a grant ‒ though it would have been nice if they had done. ‒ I'm pretty well, &amp; I'm working but not particularly well. I get tired soon. The climate here, too, is <hi rend="underline">very</hi> relaxing. (But I'm not making that responsible.) ‒ As I wrote to you, I planned to go to Norway in August, but I can't go; I <hi rend="underline">may</hi> go in Autumn. The man with whom I thought of going has to cram for an exam which he failed in July. So maybe I'll see Bouwsma when he arrives here in August. I have hardly any philosophical discussions. I could see students if I wanted, but I don't want to. I've got all sorts of unclear thoughts in my old head which perhaps will remain there for ever in this unsatisfactory state.</p> <p rend="indent">If ever I became clearer again, which is very unlikely, it would be good to have some more talks with you. ‒ Give my good wishes to Doney, if he's still within reach.</p> <p rend="indent">Let me hear from you again before long.</p> <p rend="indent"><hi rend="underline">As always</hi>,</p> <p rend="indent">affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> <p rend="indent">P.S. Thanks for the jacket. I'd forgotten all about it &amp; it's mended <hi rend="underline">beautifully</hi>!</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
