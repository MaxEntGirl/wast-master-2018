CAMB.</p> <p rend="right">Saturday</p> <p>Dear v. Wright,</p> <p rend="indent">Thanks for your letter. <hi rend="underline">Sorry</hi> you weren't able to come to my class! Not that you lost anything. ‒ The two items I bring along with this letter are not meant to be looked at, but to be eaten. Of the vitamin B, you take a tablet a day. It <hi rend="underline">can't</hi> do you any harm but <hi rend="underline">may</hi> do you a lot of good; it has helped me when I was run down. The black currant puree was given to me as a present. I pass it on because I <hi rend="doubleunderline">really</hi> don't need it; <hi rend="underline">you do</hi>! Don't make any fuss but eat it. ‒ I was very glad to read the kind words you said in your letter about Kreisel &amp; Miss Anscombe. (I, too, respect both of them very much.) You made a "?" over Miss Anscombes name, ‒ I wonder, why. You couldn't possibly have mistaken Mrs Braithwaite for her, could you? ‒ I shall expect you on Monday morning between 9.30 &amp; 10.30 in my room. I very much hope you'll soon recover.</p> <p rend="indent">So long!</p> <p rend="right">L. Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
