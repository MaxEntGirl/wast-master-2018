These lines I wrote a week ago &amp; then was interrupted. The next day your letter arrived. I was <hi rend="underline">very</hi> glad to hear from you. It would be ever so good to see you again. I too regret that for external &amp; internal reasons I can't do philosophy, for that's the only work that's given me real satisfaction. No other work really bucks me up. I'm extremely busy now &amp; my mind is kept occupied the whole time but at the end of the day I just feel tired &amp; sad. ‒ Well, <hi rend="underline">perhaps</hi> better times will come again. ‒ I haven't heard from Smythies for <hi rend="underline">many</hi> months. I know he is in Oxford but he doesn't write to me. ‒ Lewy is still at Cambridge, which, I'm sure, is very bad for him &amp; not good for anyone else. Rhees is still lecturing at Swansea &amp; as good as ever. I very rarely come to Cambridge now, about once every three months. I've given up my rooms in College. I'm supposed, of course, to come back there as a professor after the war, but I must say I can't quite imagine how I'll be able to do it. I wonder if I'll ever be able to teach philosophy again regularly. I rather think I shan't be able.</p> <p rend="indent">I hope you'll see Moore &amp; find him in good health. I hear the book about him has appeared ‒ but I shan't read it. ‒</p> <p rend="indent">Write to me again before long! <hi rend="underline">Good luck</hi>!</p> <p rend="indent">Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
