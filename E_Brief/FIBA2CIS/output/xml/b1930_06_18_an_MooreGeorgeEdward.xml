I'm very grateful to the Council for its munificence.</p> <p rend="indent">I'm glad to hear you are enjoying your holydays. I don't yet enjoy mine, for I haven't yet been able to do any proper work, partly, I believe, due to the opressive heat we've had here during the last week or so, &amp; partly because my brain simply won't work. I hope to God this state won't last long. It is very depressing when all the lights are put out as if there had <hi rend="underline">never</hi> been any burning. However, I dare say it'll pass over. ‒ Would you be so very kind &amp; take the Midsummer £50 for me &amp; send them on to my Address? If it's not to[o] much trouble for you I should be very much obliged if you would.</p> <p rend="indent">I hope your vacation will continue satisfactorily &amp; that mine will soon be allright too. I'ld be very glad if you would let me hear from you again some time how you're getting on etc.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours ever</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
