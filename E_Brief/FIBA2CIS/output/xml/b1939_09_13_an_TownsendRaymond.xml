I was very glad to hear from you. I shall be in Cambridge for 5 or 6 days now. Could you come here? Possibly I'll be here right till term starts at the beginning of October. I feel terribly uncertain about my future &amp; have a kind of longing to jump out of my own skin.</p> <p rend="indent">I am sorry to hear that you had a painful business before you left England.</p> <p rend="indent">Re neglecting ones friends, I think you perhaps slightly misunderstood me. I didn't doubt that if a friend called you &amp; said he was in desperate need to see you you'ld <hi rend="underline">make</hi> time to see him ‒ but, if you will only see your friends when they are in desperate need of you <hi rend="underline">they won't call you</hi> even if they are. That's the point. One doesn't ask a man's help whom one never sees &amp; of whom one only knows theoretically that in a great emergency he'ld come. Partly because an emergency isn't anything clearly defined. ‒</p> <p rend="indent">However I'm not going to philosophize about that.</p> <p rend="indent">I hope to see you soon.</p> <p rend="indent">Ever yours affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
