There are still some <hi rend="underline">very</hi> difficult problems (&amp; very fundamental ones too) to be solved &amp; I won't begin to write untill I have got some sort of a solution for them. However I don't think that will in any way affect the Bipolarity-business which still seems to me to be absolutely untangible. Pinsent is an enormous comfort to me here. We have hired a little sailing boat &amp; go about with it on the fiord, or rather Pinsent is doing all the sailing &amp; I sit in the boat &amp; work. Shall I get anything out??! It would be awfull if I did not &amp; all my work would be lost. However I am not loosing courage &amp; go on thinking. Pray for me! If you see the Whiteheads please remember me to them. My address for the next 3 weeks shall be:</p> <p rend="indent">Hotel Öistensjö</p> <p rend="indent">Öistensjö Norway.</p> <p rend="indent">If you've nothing better to do, <hi rend="underline">do</hi> write to me how you are etc. I very often now have the indescribable feeling as though my work was all sure to be lost entirely in some way or other. But I still hope that this won't come true. What ever happens don't forget me!</p> <p rend="indent">Yours ever most etc</p> <p rend="right">L. W.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
