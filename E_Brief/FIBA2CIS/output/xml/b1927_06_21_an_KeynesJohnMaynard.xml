I haven't even thanked you for your little book about Russia which you sent me about a year &amp; a half ago. I won't try to explain my long silence: there were lots of reasons for it. I had a great many troubles one overlapping the other &amp; postponed writing untill they would be all over. But now I have interrupted my troubles by a short holyday &amp; this is the occasion to write to you. I have given up teaching long ago (about 14 month)* &amp; have taken to architecture. I'm building a house in Vienna. This gives me heaps of troubles &amp; I'm not even sure that I'm not going to make a mess of it. However I believe it will be finished about November &amp; then I might take a trip to England if anybody there should care to see me. I should <hi rend="doubleunderline">very</hi> much like to see you again &amp; meanwhile to get a line from you.</p> <p rend="indent">About your book I forgot to say that I liked it. It shows that you know that there are more things between heave[n] &amp; earth etc.</p> <p rend="indent">Please remember me to your wife.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours ever</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> <p rend="indent">* I couldn't stand the hot bottle any longer.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
