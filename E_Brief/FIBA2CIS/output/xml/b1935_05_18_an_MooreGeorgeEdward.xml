I don't mean serious, because of the difficulty to find a job; but serious because she is now actually standing at a crossroad. One road leading to perpetual misjudging of her intellectual powers and thereby to hurt pride and vanity etc. etc. The other would lead her to a knowledge of her own capacities and that <hi rend="underline">always</hi> has good consequences. ‒ You are the only person who now has any influence on her and I wish you'ld use it for a good end! ‒ I have given up the idea to talk to Newman. I think the right thing for me is not to have my hand in this matter any more. Whether I shall write to 'Mind' or not I don't yet know.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours ever</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
