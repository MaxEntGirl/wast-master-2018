It's nice to know that you'll be thinking of me on the ship ‒ but I want to say something &amp; I mean it seriously: there is such a thing as neglecting your friends. Thinking of them is nice but it's rather easy &amp; doesn't do them much good. They sometimes need advice, sometimes help sometimes just backing up &amp; if you never see them you give them no opportunity to show you what they need. (I, at this moment, need neither advice nor help. But it's good to know that there is someone somewhere who takes a <hi rend="underline">real</hi> interest in you.) ‒ It may be a nuisance that in this world we have bodies &amp; senses &amp; can't have purely <hi rend="underline">spiritual</hi> contact with each other; but there's no getting away from this fact. ‒ Of course I don't <hi rend="doubleunderline">know</hi> that you haven't <hi rend="underline">most excellent</hi> reasons for isolating yourself. On the other hand I think it just conceivable that you aren't <hi rend="underline">quite</hi> aware that you're drifting away from friends (who, as I said, have <hi rend="underline">bodies</hi>.).</p> <p rend="indent">What I wish to say comes to something like this: please check up on these items in your accounts. If they're all right I've nothing more to say; only I thought there might be something not quite all right about them. Supposing for a moment that this were so I couldn't, of course, reproach you for it, for in <hi rend="underline">my</hi> life there's nothing at all that's <hi rend="underline">all right</hi>. But I should be sorry if you were overlooking something which, I can't help feeling, is rather important.</p> <p rend="indent">I wish you lots of good luck.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
