London S.W.3</p> <p rend="right">24.12.21</p> <p>Dear Wittgenstein</p> <p rend="indent">Thanks for your letter. Ostwald had already printed before I saw the proofs ‒ I think it must be out by now ‒ Ogden has done all the business, &amp; is going ahead with getting your work published in English. The publication is all arranged for. The publisher will be Kegan Paul. The translation is being done by two young men at Cambridge who know mathematical logic, &amp; I am telling them all that you &amp; I agreed on as regards translations of terms. What I saw of Ostwald's stuff was all right, &amp; not in his "insane" orthography. In the English publication, we are trying to get the German text also printed, but I am not sure whether the publisher will agree.</p> <p rend="indent">Our boy was born on Nov.16 &amp; flourishes ‒ He is called John Conrad (the latter after the novelist of that name, who is a friend of mine). My wife is now quite recovered &amp; we are both very happy.</p> <p rend="indent">I am sorry to hear you are not well. Remember that we shall both be overjoyed if you can ever come to see us, &amp; that it will be easy to pay all your expenses by selling a few of your things which are of no use to me. Your property was worth much more than Jolley pretended. Your books alone were worth £100, &amp; I don't see why I should swindle you because Jolley understated the value of your things. £300 would have been a fair price. I will send you the extra £200 if you will accept it, or give you back anything of yours that you want when you come, whichever you prefer.</p> <p rend="indent">Best wishes for the New Year, &amp; much love ‒</p> <p rend="indent">Yrs ever</p> <p rend="right">Bertrand Russell.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
