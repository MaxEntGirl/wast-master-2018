Thanks! I am now in very good bodily health &amp; my work isn't going bad either. I have occasional queer states of nervous instability about which I'll only say that they're rotten while they last, &amp; teach one to pray.</p> <p rend="indent">I've never read "The works of love". Kierkegaard is far too deep for me, anyhow. He bewilders me without working the good effects which he would in <hi rend="underline">deeper</hi> souls. ‒ Years ago Drury read to Skinner &amp; me the beginning of the "Conquest of Mexico" which we found very interesting indeed. That I didn't like the parsonish point of view of Prescott's is, of course, a different story. ‒ I am not reading much, [th]ank God. I read in Grimm's fairy tales &amp; in Bismarck's 'Gedanken &amp; Erinnerungen' which I admire greatly. I don't mean, of course, that my views are Bismarck's views. It's written in very excellent, though rather difficult German, as the sentences are very long. Otherwise I'd recommend you to look at it.</p> <p rend="indent">I wish you <hi rend="underline">lots</hi> of good luck, &amp; I know you wish me the same; &amp; <hi rend="underline">do I need it!</hi></p> <p rend="indent">All the best to Lee &amp; Ray.</p> <p rend="indent">Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> <p rend="indent">I haven't anyone at all to talk to here, &amp; this is good &amp; in a way bad. It would be good to see someone occasionally to whom one could say a really friendly word. I don't need <hi rend="underline">conversations</hi>. What I'd like would be someone to smile at occasionally.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
