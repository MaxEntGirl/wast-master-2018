I’ld like to know if they actually were mendable and, if so, whether they were mended. I’m in no hurry for them. If I have them by the end of August it’s all right. So please enquire. I feel a great deal better here than in Cambridge. That’s only natural. I work a fair amount though only moderately successfully. I don’t know where I’ll spend my sabbatical Michaelmas Term, nor whether I hadn’t better resign my job for good, as that term, in all likelihood, won’t be enough for me to get a part of my book ready for publication (if this can be done at all). For this seems to be the thing I want to do.</p> <p rend="indent"> I got a copy of “Changing World” and have read  your review and it isn’t bad, I think. In fact the reviews seemed to me to be the best part of that magazine; the articles, I thought, were muck.</p> <p rend="indent">I’m intending to go to Ireland to see Drury on Aug. 6th and to return on Aug. 19th. Between Aug. 19th and Sept. 12th I’ll probably be in Ickenham with Richards, and then I hope to go to Austria for 3 weeks. About Oct. 7th I’ll be in Cambridge for a few days.</p> <p rend="indent">My soul is as much in a mess as it was before, but I’m in better health and in far more human surroundings and therefore happier. Give my good wishes to your wife.</p> <p rend="right"> Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
