W. 3</p> <p rend="right"> 7.2.22</p> <p>Dear Wittgenstein</p> <p rend="indent">I was very glad to get your letter the other day, with your nice message to the little boy, which, as you suggested, I conveyed by appropriate symbols other than words. He flourishes, &amp; gives us both great happiness.</p> <p rend="indent">I wonder you haven't heard from Ostwald. Have you written to him to tell him your address? If not, I don't suppose he knows it. I have heard nothing further about publication of your book, either here or in Germany, but I will find out next time I see Ogden.</p> <p rend="indent">We intend to go to Germany &amp; Switzerland next August. If you have holidays then, I hope we could see you then ‒ it would be easier for you, I suppose, than coming to England. In Switzerland we intend to stay with my brother's wife, who used to be Gräfin Arnim. I am sure she would be delighted to have you too, if you could come. I am <hi rend="underline">very</hi> glad you will let me pay your expenses. If you <hi rend="underline">can</hi> come to England sooner, do.</p> <p rend="indent">I liked China much better than Europe ‒ the people are more civilized ‒ I keep wishing I were back there. I lectured to them on all sorts of topics, but what they liked best was mathematical logic.</p> <p rend="indent">I wish you didn't have to work so hard at elementary teaching ‒ it must be very dreary. Would you like me to bring your journals &amp; note-books when we next meet? Take care of yourself ‒ With love,</p> <p rend="indent">Yours ever</p> <p rend="right">Bertrand Russell ‒</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
