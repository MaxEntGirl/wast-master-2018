As soon as I got it I sat down to answer it &amp; wrote about half a page. Then I was interrupted, from that moment the planets were adverse &amp; something always kept me from writing. ‒ I needn't say that I was very pleased indeed to hear that you had got your scholarship; though I never doubted that you would get it. ‒ I am looking forward to dining with you &amp; I'm sure the american food will be good; but I must say that I don't mind a bit going to Lyon's every day. In fact I'm fond of the place. ‒ I was glad to hear that you had talked to Belmont. It was the <hi rend="underline">right</hi> thing to do &amp; good for all concerned.</p> <p rend="indent">I hope to talk about the foundations of Math. next year though I certainly should begin with it. I wonder what our class will be like!</p> <p rend="indent">I'm afraid I shan't see you before autumn as I'm not in Vienna in August except for a few days when I shall be very busy.</p> <p rend="indent">I hope this letter will reach you before October.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours very sincerely</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
