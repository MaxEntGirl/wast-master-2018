Last night, in your room, I made a remark which I think you may not have understood, as I expressed myself badly, but which I <hi rend="underline">want</hi> you to understand. I said that my brain had deteriorated &amp; I added that you, too, didn’t think properly – as though I thought these two things were on the same level. – This however I don’t think. The deterioration of my thinking powers seems to me to be something <hi rend="underline">permanent</hi>, as though it were due to physiological causes; the decline which I seem to observe in your thinking I believe to be a thing about which something can be done &amp; to which, therefore, your attention should be drawn. This decline I seem to see I did not recognise as such until fairly recently. Its symptom is that you are unable now to stand decently by <hi rend="underline">strong contradiction</hi>, the contradiction of someone, I mean, who mistrusts your reasoning – which reasoning seems to me to be <hi rend="underline">very</hi> often <hi rend="underline">muddled</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">superficial</hi>. So, of course, everybody’s thinking tends to be: but you used to take contradiction as a medicine; &amp; by contradiction I don’t mean the expression of polite disagreement but a <hi rend="underline">challenge</hi>! You did not always take it graciously (but who would?) but you used not when contradicted to kick with forelegs &amp; hindlegs like some animals. When first I noticed this kicking, which consists in talking <hi rend="doubleunderline">extremely</hi> offensively, I could not interpret it rightly (&amp; perhaps I don’t now, but I <hi rend="underline">think</hi> I do). One might object to this saying: “How can W. judge Sraffa’s reaction to people contradicting him, as he has never seen Sraffa’s reaction to anyone but himself?” – My answer is that, in my opinion, a man who can’t stick a strenuous discussion with me, 1000 to 1, can’t stick a strenuous discussion at all. I don’t mean that I don’t often have a very disagreable &amp; tiresome way of talking, or that this isn’t reprehensible, but that, in my experience, people who wanted to thrash out a question properly, put up with my more nasty qualities because they found me very useful.</p> <p rend="indent">It therefore is my opinion that it isn’t simply these qualities which in a discussion with me exasperate you – to the point of making a <hi rend="underline">deep</hi> discussion now impossible – but that the cause of this is, to put it bluntly, that you have in some way gone <hi rend="underline">soft</hi>. – Why this should be so I don’t know; but I have thought that it might perhaps be due to the fact that <hi rend="underline">many</hi> more people admire you now than used to a few years ago: &amp; when we talked about the bad effects which admiration had on Prof. Hardy I did not only think of myself as another example but also of you.</p> <p rend="indent">I may, of course, be <hi rend="doubleunderline">all wrong</hi>, &amp; if I am – well, no harm is done by my having told you what I think. If I’m not, however, no harm is done either so it follows, logically, that no harm’s done anyway.</p> <p rend="indent">I am with good feelings,</p> <p rend="indent">yours </p> <p rend="indent">Ludwig Wittgenstein </p> </div> </div></body></text></TEI>
