I've had a bad time lately: soul, mind &amp; body. I felt exceedingly depressed for many weeks, then fell ill &amp; now I'm weak &amp; completely dull. I haven't done any work for 5-6 weeks. I'm living alone in a cottage here on the west coast right on the sea, far from civilisation. I arrived here 2 days ago &amp; am not yet at home at all. I'll have to learn gradually how to do my housework without loosing too much time &amp; strength. During my illness I read "Monkey" &amp;, to my surprise, found it agreeable to read, I hadn't expected it. ‒ What gets me down most is that my nights are bad. If they mend, &amp; I hope they will, I have a chance. ‒ I haven't heard from Smythies or Miss Anscombe for a <hi rend="underline">long</hi> time. I had a letter from von Wright a few days ago. He had lots of anxiety recently for political reasons, but things seem to be less dangerous now. ‒ Do you ever hear from Moore? I shan't write more today, I'm much too dull. Give my best wishes to Lee &amp; Ray &amp; look after yourself!</p> <p rend="indent">Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
