I'm <hi rend="underline">sorry</hi> to hear about the depressing circumstances under which you are working. Please don't give in, or despair! I know how immensely depressing things can look; &amp;, of course, I'm the first man to think of running away, but I hope you'll pull yourself together. I wonder what lines for a logic course I recommended. Anyhow, there's nothing more difficult than to teach logic with <hi rend="underline">any</hi> success when your students are all half asleep. (I've heard Braithwaite <hi rend="underline">snore</hi> in my lectures.) Please go the <hi rend="underline">bloody rough</hi> way! ‒ I wish you <hi rend="underline">one</hi> <hi rend="underline">moderately</hi> intelligent &amp; awake pupil to sweeten your labour! Please look after your health. You <hi rend="underline">can't</hi> expect good work when your health isn't really good, &amp; colds are nasty things. I've so far been in good health, &amp; consequently my classes haven't gone too bad. (Or should I say "badly"?) Thouless is coming to them, &amp; a woman, M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> so &amp; so who calls herself Miss Anscombe, who certainly is intelligent, though not of Kreisel's caliber.</p> <p rend="indent">I heard from Malcolm recently who is executive Officer of a ship (whatever that means) &amp; was, when he wrote me, <hi rend="underline">in England</hi>, but only for a few hours. ‒ Drury is in France &amp; I get news from him regularly.</p> <p rend="indent">I have recently been reading a fair amount: a history of the Mormons &amp; two books of Newman's. The chief effect of this reading is to make me feel a little more my worthlessness. Though I'm aware of it only as a slumbering man is aware of certain noises going on around him which, however, don't wake him up.</p> <p rend="indent">I repeat: Please go the bloody, rough way! <hi rend="underline">Complain</hi>, <hi rend="underline">swear</hi>, but go on. The students are stupid but they get something out of it.</p> <p rend="indent">Please give my good wishes to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Rhees. Remember me to any of your people who remember me.</p> <p rend="indent">Smythies is coming up on Saturday to read a paper at the M. Sc. Cl. (subject unknown). So long! Luck!</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
