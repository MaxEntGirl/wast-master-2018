Camb.</p> <p rend="right">10.9.34.</p> <p>Dear Stevenson,</p> <p rend="indent">Thanks so much for your letter, dated June 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. I'm glad you passed your written exams &amp; I'm sure you did well in your oral ones as well. I hope you'll enjoy teaching; but if you're any good at it I think your enjoiment will be kept down somewhat by the discovery of how <hi rend="underline">enormously</hi> difficult it is to get clear enough about a thing to be able to explain it to another man without cheating him &amp; yourself. I mean that if you don't find it <hi rend="underline">overwhelmingly</hi> difficult to teach phoilosophy you won't be much good at it. For I imagine that "rock-bottom honesty", as you call it, is damn difficult to acquire.</p> <p rend="indent">As to "bringing your own fragmentary ideas into something like a coherent order", I thought there would be time enough for that when you were 60. I thought it would be heaps if you could write a few decent fragments. One day you'll see that this is true. ‒ Last academic year was a great strain but I've taken a good rest now for almost a month &amp; so ought to be able to do some work again soon. I've been to Austria for 6 weeks &amp; come back here a week ago. In a few days I shall be going to Ireland to stay a fortnight with Drury whom I suppose you'll remember. Then I shall come back here for good. I wonder what my class will be like &amp; what my own head will be like. ‒ Miss Ambrose has got a research scholarship for the next year. She has been doing very well indeed.</p> <p rend="indent">Please remember me to Mrs Stevenson &amp; to Cooley if you see him.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours very sincerely</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> <p rend="indent">Let me hear from you again before long.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
