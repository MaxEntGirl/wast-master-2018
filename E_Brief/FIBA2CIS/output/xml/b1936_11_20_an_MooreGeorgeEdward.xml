Nov.</p> <p>Dear Moore</p> <p rend="indent">I was glad to get your letter. My work isn't going badly. I don't know if I wrote to you that when I came here I began to translate into &amp; rewrite in German the stuff I had dictated to Skinner &amp; Miss Ambrose. When about a fortnight ago, I read through what I had done so far I found it all, or nearly all, boring &amp; artificial. For having the english version before me had cramped my thinking. I therefore decided to start all over again &amp; not to let my thoughts be guided by anything but themselves. ‒ I found it difficult the first day or two but then it became easy. And so I'm writing now a new version &amp; I hope I'm not wrong in saying that it's somewhat better than the last. ‒ Besides this all sorts of things have been happening inside me (I mean in my mind). I won't write about them now, but when I come to Cambridge, as I intend to do for a few days about New Year, I hope to God I shall be able to talk to you about them; &amp; I shall then want your advice &amp; your help in some very difficult &amp; serious matters. ‒</p> <p rend="indent">I was very glad to hear that Skinner came to the Mor. Sc. Club &amp; that he spoke. I wish it were possible for you to see him once in a while! It would do him masses of good. For he <hi rend="underline">needs</hi> someone he can talk to decently &amp; seriously!</p> <p rend="indent">If ever you see Ryle or write to him give him my love. I can quite imagine that he didn't read a good paper &amp; also that he was nice &amp; decent &amp; agreeable in the discussion.</p> <p rend="indent">I intend to leave here for Vienna about Dec. 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> &amp; to come to Cambridge about the 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Dec. &amp; to stay <hi rend="underline">about</hi> a week.</p> <p rend="indent">Best wishes!</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
