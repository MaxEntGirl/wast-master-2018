I'm glad you got the book. Somehow I'd been certain that they hadn't sent it to you. ‒ But what a queer thing to write "It's terribly nice of you to think of us"! You couldn't have thought at all when you wrote that. ‒ Now as to Moore: ‒ I don't really understand Moore, &amp;, therefore, what I'll say may be quite wrong. But this is what I'm inclined to say: ‒ That Moore is in some sense extraordinarily childlike is obvious, &amp; the remark you quoted (about vanity) is certainly an example of that childlikeness. There is also a <hi rend="underline">certain</hi> innocence about Moore; he is, e.g., completely unvain. As to it's being to his "<hi rend="underline">credit</hi>" to be childlike, ‒ I can't understand that; unless it's also to a <hi rend="underline">child's</hi> credit. For you aren't talking of the innocence a man has fought for, but of an innocence which comes from a natural absence of a temptation. ‒ I believe that all you wanted to say was that you <hi rend="underline">liked</hi>, or even <hi rend="underline">loved</hi>, Moore's childlikeness. And that I can <hi rend="underline">understand</hi>. ‒ I think that our discrepancy here is not so much one of thoughts as of feelings. I <hi rend="underline">like</hi> &amp; greatly respect Moore, but that's all. He doesn't warm my heart (or very little), because what warms my heart most is human kindness, &amp; Moore ‒ <hi rend="underline">just like a child</hi> ‒ is not kind. He is kind<hi rend="underline">ly</hi> &amp; he can be charming &amp; nice to those he likes &amp; he has great <hi rend="underline">depth</hi>. ‒ That's how it seems to me. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong. ‒ My work is still going fairly well, though not as well as, say, 6 weeks ago. That's partly due to the fact that I've been a bit ill, &amp; also that a number of things are really worrying me. ‒ Money is not one of them. I am, of course, spending rather a lot, but I'll have enough for another 2 years, I think. During that time, God being willing, I'll get some work done; &amp; that, after all, was why I resigned my professorship. I mustn't worry about money <hi rend="underline">now</hi>, for if I did I couldn't work. (What will happen after that time I don't yet know. Maybe I won't live that long anyway.) ‒ One of my present worries is the health of one of my sisters in Vienna. She was operated on cancer a short time ago &amp; the operation, as far as it went, was successful, but she won't have <hi rend="underline">long</hi> to live. For that reason I <hi rend="underline">intend</hi> to go to Vienna sometime next spring; &amp; that's got something to do with you, because if I go &amp; come back to England afterwards I intend to dictate the stuff that I've been writing since last autumn, &amp; <hi rend="underline">if</hi> I do, I'll send you a copy. May it act as manure on your field.</p> <p rend="indent">Give all my good wishes to Lee &amp; Raymond. (I wish he'd <hi rend="underline">always</hi> remain good-natured. But I know that's a tall order.) So long!</p> <p rend="indent">Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
