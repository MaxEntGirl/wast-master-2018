I'm afraid you were right: my illness lasted much longer than I had expected, &amp; even now I haven't completely regained my former strength. When it was at it's hight I had the news that my eldest sister had suddenly to be operated on cancer. The operation was successful &amp; the doctors said that she might live 2 or 3 years, but a few weeks after the operation she had a slight stroke &amp; a worse one after that, &amp; now she is dieing. She has no pain but she is getting weaker &amp; weaker, &amp; is sleeping most of the time. My two other sisters who are with her think that my coming would only upset her. I told them, of course, that if there were the slightest chance of my eldest sister wishing to see me they should send me a medical certificate &amp; I could be in Vienna within a week. It would be no sacrifice for me to go. ‒ My work went fairly well, &amp; sometimes even very well, in all this time; I was too ill to work for only 4 or 5 days; but about a fortnight ago I almost suddenly became exhausted, my ideas petered out, &amp; now I'm completely incapable of thinking about philosophy. This doesnt necessarily mean that I couldn't discuss philosophy, but I can't write. God knows if I'll ever be able to work again, but I feel that I'll <hi rend="underline">certainly</hi> not be able to work soon. <hi rend="underline">Perhaps</hi> a holiday of a couple of months would make me fit again. Ten days ago Richards came here for a week &amp; we went to Ho[w]th together &amp; spent the week there. It was very enjoyable, but the weather was mostly foul 'e.g. cold East wind &amp; damp &amp; windy' Richards left yesterday. ‒ Nothing has changed about Drury. He is as busy as before, or busier still, &amp; there seems <hi rend="underline">no hope</hi> of any change. We've never been further than the Zoo together. ‒ He has passed his exam of course &amp; is now second in command at the hospital, next to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Moore. His room, however, is just as it was, only there is now a better electric fire in it. ‒ I don't know at all what my movements in the near or far future will be. I <hi rend="underline">may</hi> go to Vienna, or I may stay here, or I may for a time go to England &amp; in that case I hope to see you, but I don't know anything at present. ‒ The Malcolms invited me over to America (Ithaca N. Y.). Perhaps one day I'll go, but I'm unable just now to decide anything. ‒ I should <hi rend="underline">very</hi> much like to see you &amp; have talks with you. As soon as I <hi rend="underline">know</hi> anything I'll let you know. I can well believe that you aren't going to Birmingham for your pleasure. Of course it's conceivable that they'll do something decent there, but I confess I can't imagine it. I don't trust M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Duncan Jones.</p> <p rend="indent">Well, so long! &amp; good luck! I know you wish me the same.</p> <p rend="indent">As always</p> <p rend="right">L. Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
