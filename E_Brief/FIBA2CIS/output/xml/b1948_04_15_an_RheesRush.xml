I often thought of you these days &amp;, although that may sound awful, often thought thank God I wrote to you not to come to see me at Easter. For the last 6 or 8 weeks have been a bad time for me. First I suffered much terrible depressions, then I had a bad flu, &amp; all the time I didn't know where to go from here. I am now gradually getting better &amp; I intend leaving here next week &amp; to go to Rosro in the West. This has <hi rend="underline">great</hi> disadvantages (it's a 10 hours journey from Dublin) but there's nothing else I can do, so far as I can see. So, had you come, you'd have found me in a state of great tribulation. Wish me <hi rend="underline">some</hi> strength, <hi rend="underline">some</hi> courage, &amp; luck! During the last month my work has hardly progressed at all, &amp; only in the last few days I've been able to think a little (I mean, about philosophy; for my brain, though <hi rend="underline">dull</hi>, wasn't inactive I wish it had been!). ‒ I wish I could see you before long &amp;, who knows, I might come to England before you go to America: It's in no way clear that I'll be able to live in Rosro. In fact I've got grave doubts, but I've got to try. ‒ I shall let you know my new address as soon as I get there. Post will of course be forwarded from here. ‒ I hardly ever see a paper these days, but what I saw about 2-3 weeks ago looked pretty dangerous. I mean, as though a war might come long before I thought it might. (I had an unfounded belief that no war would come within the next 5 years.)</p> <p rend="indent">Forgive this queer letter!</p> <p rend="indent">May you be moderately lucky!</p> <p rend="indent">As always,</p> <p rend="right">L. Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
