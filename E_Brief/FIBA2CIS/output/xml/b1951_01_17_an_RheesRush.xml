I'm even more muddled these days than usual. Thanks anyway. I was <hi rend="underline">very</hi> glad to get a present from you. The trouble partly was that I was ill at Christmas lying in my good doctor's house at Cambridge. There, by the way, I read a book which interested me &amp; which I liked. It's called "Rommel" &amp; is a kind of biography of the German general written by a brigadier Young. It seemed to me rather well written &amp; with great fairness.</p> <p rend="indent">I hope you will have a moderately good Lent Term. Good wishes as always,</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
