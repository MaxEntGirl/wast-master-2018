I got it almost a week ago but couldn't reply because my thoughts were in such a turmoil; &amp; even today I may not be able to produce anything better than a jumble of incoherent sentences. First let me say a) that I feel deeply grateful for your kindness &amp; b) that, I feel <hi rend="underline">strongly</hi> tempted to accept your invitation. But there are huge difficulties. ‒ My eldest sister is, to the best of my knowledge, still alive &amp; my two younger sisters <hi rend="underline">may</hi> still want me to go to Vienna before long. If this happened I'd probably go to Vienna within the next 3 weeks &amp; stay there for 3 or 4 weeks. ‒ I went to a travel agency to enquire about going to America &amp; found out that the journey there &amp; back would cost me somewhere between 80 &amp; 120 pounds. Further I'm told that you alone will have to pay for my upkeep in America, as I'm not allowed to take with me more than £ 5. In fact I gather that you'd have to send affidavids stating that you are able &amp; willing to pay for all my expences during my stay in the U.S.A.. If these regulations did not exist I could, theoretically, spend my own money in America, but in fact <hi rend="underline">I couldn't afford that</hi>. I could afford the trip only by staying with you for <hi rend="underline">2, or 3 months</hi> &amp; sponging on you! ‒ Now the prospect of staying with you for that length of time is very pleasant as far as I'm concerned, but there is the snag that I am an elderly man &amp; aging pretty rappidly. I mean, physically, not, as far as I can see, mentally. Now this means that you couldn't take me on any <hi rend="underline">tours</hi>. I'm all right for strolling about but I can't do <hi rend="underline">very</hi> much more than I did at Cambridge. ‒ For the same reason I wouldn't be any good at gardening. ‒ If it weren't for all these difficulties I'd come <hi rend="underline">like a shot</hi>, for I'd love to stay with you, have discussions with one of you &amp; make myself a general nuisance to the other. ‒ I've forgotten to mention another thing. If I booked a 3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> class passage right away I couldn't get a birth before the middle of July; if I booked 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> class, which is <hi rend="underline">much</hi> more expensive, I could travel towards the middle, or end of May. Heaven knows where you might be in July, but even if I came earlier I'd have to stay with you until September &amp; be a dead weight during your summer vacations. ‒ This, as far as I can see now in my confused state of mind, is the position. ‒ </p> <p rend="indent">I imagine that you didn't quite realize all these snags when you invited me. Please take <hi rend="underline">everything</hi> that I've said in this letter seriously &amp; at it's face-value.</p> <p rend="indent">Thank you again for your great kindness.</p> <p rend="indent">Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
