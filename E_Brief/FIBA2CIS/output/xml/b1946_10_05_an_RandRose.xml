I am quite certain that I shall be unable to give you advice which will be of any use to you. It is, therefore, a waste of time if you come to see me. After I had received your letter I went to see someone at the 'Society for the Protect. of Science &amp; Learning' to ask whether they had heard from you. I was told that you were trying ||again|| to get some sort of academic job. I must tell you quite bluntly that I have <hi rend="underline">not</hi> changed my mind about your qualification for such a job, or about the likelihood of your getting one. I am unable to recommend you for an academic post myself, &amp; I can’t advise you to try for such a post as I do not think that you have a chance.</p> <p rend="indent">The only advice I can give you is to do work in which you can make use of your manual skill &amp; <hi rend="underline">not</hi> to think that it’s shameful to do <hi rend="line-through">w</hi> <hi rend="underline">decent</hi> work with your hands.</p> <p rend="indent">As this is all that I can say, please stop asking me for my opinion &amp; advice.</p> <p rend="indent">May a ray of real intelligence enlighten you!</p> </div> <div type="salute" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"> <p rend="indent">Yours sincerely </p> <p rend="indent">L.
