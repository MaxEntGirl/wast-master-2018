I found it when I came back from Norway about 10 days ago. I was away 5 weeks &amp; before that I was illish for about a month. In Norway the friend who went with me fell ill with bronchitis <hi rend="underline">twice</hi>. So there was no end of trouble &amp; I postponed writing to my friends from one day to the other. This doesn't mean that we didn't enjoy our journey, for we <hi rend="underline">did</hi>, &amp; we had wonderful weather. I had intended to do some work but I didn't do any. I may possibly go back to Norway before long &amp; try to work; it's the only place I know where I can have real quiet. Of course it's possible that I'm no longer able to do any decent research, but it's certainly worth while finding out if I am or not. Please don't talk about this plan of mine for the present. I haven't yet decided, &amp; although several people know of it, there are others I don't want to know.</p> <p rend="indent">I have given Miss Anscombe, Smythies &amp; Bouwsma your kind regards. It's always <hi rend="doubleunderline">very</hi> pleasant to see Bouwsma. He &amp; his wife are such kind &amp; natural people. I am very glad that he sees Smythies regularly; I can't imagin that he sees many people in this place worth seeing. He also has had a good many discussions with Miss A.. â€’ You're quite right, a mathematician by name of Turing attended my lectures in '39 (they were <hi rend="underline">pretty</hi> poor!) &amp; it's probably the same man who wrote the article you mention. I havent read it but I imagine it's <hi rend="underline">no</hi> leg-pull. Von Wright is in Finland &amp; is coming back to Cambridge in January. I don't know if I shall see him. I saw my doctor there the other day &amp; looked up Moore. He seemed pretty well but says he must take it very easy because of his heart.</p> <p rend="indent">Give my love to Lee &amp; remember me to Doney &amp; D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mooney. I should very much like to see them again though it's very unlikely that I will.</p> <p rend="indent">My health is not too bad but I am very dull &amp; stupid indeed (as this letter shows).</p> <p rend="indent">Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
