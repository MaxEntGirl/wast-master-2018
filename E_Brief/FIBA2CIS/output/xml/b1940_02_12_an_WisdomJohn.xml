I want to make two remarks. 1) I believe that all you say is honest &amp; true; but I don’t believe that it’s the <hi rend="underline">whole</hi> truth. I think there’s something most essential which you haven’t said, because you weren’t aware of it. You <hi rend="underline">could</hi> become aware of it if you asked yourself the question: would you have thought of broadcasting the fact that you had been bored if not I but Dr. Broad had bored you? - I believe that the true answer to this question is a clue to the whole business</p> <p rend="indent">2) If you say that it’s an exageration to call Joad’s paper a ‘rotten attack’ it certainly is not an exageration in the sense that I overstated my feelings or that I worked myself up into violent indignation. The words ‘rotten attack’ were a very short but rather a <hi rend="underline">mild</hi> expression of my opinion of Joad’s paper, which I believe to be <hi rend="tripleunderline">foul</hi>, from beginning to end - I will not say more about this because it would be useless.</p> <p rend="indent">Thank you again for your letter. I know you mean well, &amp; may you not one day give up meaning well.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours </p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein </p> </div> <div type="postscript" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"> <p rend="indent">I wish to make one more remark: I should like to have you as a <hi rend="underline">friend</hi> in this departement; but only if it can be done by being frank with you, &amp; by not hiding disapproval <hi rend="underline">where I strongly feel it</hi>.</p> </div> </div></body></text></TEI>
