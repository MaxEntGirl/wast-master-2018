I liked it. Yes, I should like to see you before long; say, in July. I could come to Farnborough; but wouldn't that be definitely inconvenient for your mother? In a way I'ld prefer seeing you in Farnborough to seeing you <hi rend="underline">here</hi>. Cambridge gets on my nerves! I'm <hi rend="underline">sorry</hi> that your work is not satisfactory. Mine isn't, though in a different way.</p> <p rend="indent">I should like to see Goodstein again but I never get to Reading, &amp; anyway I'ld like to see him alone.</p> <p rend="indent">The last 6 months have been more nauseating than what went before. I wish I could leave this place &amp; this country for a while &amp; be alone somewhere as I was in Norway. I suppose many people would like that!</p> <p rend="indent">Perhaps I could stay at some Hotel in Farnborough, so I wouldn't clutter up your house.</p> <p rend="indent">Write about this.</p> <p rend="indent">So long!</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
