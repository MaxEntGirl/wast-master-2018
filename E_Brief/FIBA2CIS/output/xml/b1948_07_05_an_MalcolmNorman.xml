I ought to have known that if I ask you to send anything (the Borden coffee) you'd send ten times more. It's <hi rend="underline">all</hi> lovely &amp; most useful, but let it be my Christmaspresent, please.</p> <p rend="indent">My work isn't going well though it's moving a bit. The other day I asked myself: ought I to have left the University, oughtn't I to have gone on teaching after all? I immediately felt that I couldn't possibly have continued teaching philosophy &amp; even told myself that perhaps I ought to have resigned sooner; but then I thought of you &amp; v. Wright in Cambridge &amp; said to myself that I'd left exactly at the right moment. If my philosophical talent comes to an end now it's bad luck, but that's all.</p> <p rend="indent">I intend to stay here another 3-4 weeks &amp; then to go to Dublin to see Drury for a few days, then to Oxford for a week or so, then I want to stay with Richards (whom you haven't met) near London &amp; after that I want to go to Austria for [3-4 weeks] if I can get the permit. From Austria I'll return to this place, God being willing. ‒ Do you remember Shah, the Indian who came to my classes? He came to Leenane, a village 10 miles from here, &amp; came to see me yesterday. I was glad to see him, although our talk wasn't particularly good (I'm often tired &amp; irritable now, I'm <hi rend="underline">sorry</hi> to say). He is leaving for India in August or September. He'd rather stay in Europe, I believe, but perhaps it'll be good for him to get out of this civilisation for a bit. But how should <hi rend="underline">I</hi> know! ‒ Shah told me that Kreisel <hi rend="underline">may</hi> go to Princ[e]ton next year.</p> <p rend="indent">Thanks again &amp; all good wishes to you &amp; Lee! &amp; Raymond.</p> <p rend="indent">Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
