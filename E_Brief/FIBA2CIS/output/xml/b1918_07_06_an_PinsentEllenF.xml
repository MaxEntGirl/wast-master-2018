David was my first and my only friend. I have indeed known many young men of my own age and have been on good terms with some, but only in him did I find a real friend, the hours I have spent with him have been the best in my life, he was to me a brother and a friend. Daily I have thought of him and have longed to see him again. God will bless him. If I live to see the end of the war I will come and see you and we will talk of David.</p> <p rend="indent">One more thing, I have just finished the philosophic work on which I was already at work at Cambridge. I had always hoped to be able to show it to him sometime, and it will always be connected with him in my mind. I will dedicate it to David's memory. For he always took great interest in it, and it is to him I owe far the most part of the happy moods which made it possible for me to work. Will you please say to Mr Pinsent and to Miss Hester how very deeply I sympathise with them in their loss. I shall never forget the dear one so long as I live, nor shall I forget you who were nearest to him.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours true and thankful</p> <p rend="right">L. W.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
