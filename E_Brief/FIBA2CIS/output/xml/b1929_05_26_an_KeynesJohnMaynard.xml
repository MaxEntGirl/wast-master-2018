Please try to understand it before you critisize it. (To write it in a forei[g]n language makes it still more difficult.) But I feel I could not come to you as you wanted me to without beginning to give &amp; perhaps to ask for long explanations which I am sure you wouldn't like. When I saw you last I was confirmed in a view which had arrisen in me last term allready: you then made it very clear to me that you were tired of my conversation etc. <hi rend="underline">Now please don't think that I mind that!</hi> Why shouldn't you be tired of me, I don't believe for a moment that I can be entertaining or interesting to you. What I <hi rend="underline">did</hi> mind was to hear through your words an undertone of grudge or anoyance. Perhaps these are not exactly the right words but it was that sort of thing. I couldn't make out for some time what could be the cause of it all, untill a thought came into my head which was by an accident prooved to be correct. It was this: I thought probably you think that I cultivate your friendship amongst other reasons to be able to get some financial assistance from you if I should be in need (as you imagined I might be some day). This thought was <hi rend="underline">very</hi> disagreable to me. I was however prooved right in this way: In the beginning of this term I came to see you and wanted to return you some money you had lent me. And in my clumsy way of speaking I prefaced the act of returning it by saying "Oh, first I want money" meaning "first I want to settle the money business" or some such phrase. But you naturally misunderstood me &amp; consequently made a face in which I could read a whole story. And what followed this, I mean our conversation about the society, showed me what amount of negative feelings you had accumulated in you against me. Now this could never prevent me from having tea with you; I would be very glad if I could suppose that your grudge for which I could not see any good reason had passed away. But the second remark in your letter seems to show me that you don't want to see me as my friend but as my benefactor. But I don't accept benefactions except from my friends. (Thats why I accepted your help three years ago in Sussex.)</p> <p rend="indent">If some day you should want me to have tea with you without talking over my finances I will gladly come. â€’ Please dont answer this letter unless you can write a <hi rend="underline">short</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">kind</hi> answer. I did not write it to get explanations from you but to inform you about how I think. So if you cann't give me a kind answer in three lines, no answer will please me best.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours ever</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
