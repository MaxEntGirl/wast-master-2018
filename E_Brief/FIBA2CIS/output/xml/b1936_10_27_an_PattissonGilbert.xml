I didn't know the particular kind which one can travel with. ‒ I hope to get the typed letter to Messrs Lyons soon, for we ought to send it off before doomsday if possible, as there is, I think, no delivery that day.</p> <p rend="indent">I am in good health &amp; working fairly well. The weather has changed from marvelous to rotten. It rains like hell now. Two days ago we had the first snow. (This rime was not intended.) ‒ I enclose the photos I took on our trip. It's difficult for me however to get any copies done here. So please have those which I have packed separately copied again (one of each) &amp; send me the copies. Woolworth will do them. Also please send me a copy of each of <hi rend="underline">your</hi> photos (I mean of those <hi rend="underline">you</hi> took). And if you're at it, please send me three bottles of 'Genasprin' (2s each) &amp; please subtract the amount from the money you have of me!</p> <p rend="indent">I needn't say that I should like to hear from you.</p> <p rend="indent">Please remember me to your parents &amp; to your sister.</p> <p rend="indent">bl...</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
