I caught a cold here which wasn't too good but it's much better now. ‒ I see my eldest sister every day for a short time. It's very difficult for her to talk &amp; for me (or anyone) to understand what she is trying to say, but sometimes it's possible. When she isn't too sleepy she loves to hear my friend Koder play the piano &amp; she listens with <hi rend="underline">great</hi> intensity. He sometimes plays <hi rend="underline">heavenly</hi> &amp; always beautifully. I wish you, too, could hear him. ‒</p> <p rend="indent">If you write to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Rhees, please give her all my best wishes.</p> <p rend="indent">Thanks for your very great kindness in coming to Cambridge &amp; doing all you did for me in London! ‒ When, after that 24 hours delay, we started from the airfield my nerves were pretty much shot. I hope they'll calm down now for good. ‒ I hope to see you before long!</p> <p rend="indent">As always,</p> <p rend="indent">Yours</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
