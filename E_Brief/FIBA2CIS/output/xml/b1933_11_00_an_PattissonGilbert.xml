So I had heeps of time to write to Drury. Please let him know Claytons exact address. I looked it up in the telephon d[i]rectory but found one contradicting the one you gave me. I also want to say, which however is almost superfluous, that I enjoied yesterday hugely. I hope you weren't too<hi rend="superscript">?</hi> tired afterwards. When saying good by to you I felt that you were afraid of my making a little speech. But did I? ‒ Oh old God! ‒ Thanks again for everything. ‒ And by the way take the Sedobrol it's really excellent stuff &amp; <hi rend="underline">entirely</hi> harmless. It is <hi rend="doubleunderline">not</hi> a sleeping drug but only an extreemely mild seditive &amp; one doesnt get accustomed to it. You may absolutely rely on what I say (in <hi rend="underline">this</hi> respect) Old God ‒ </p> <p rend="indent">Yours</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> <p rend="indent">I'm afraid I couldnt bring my silver writing pad with me as I should have to pay to heavy duty on it</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
