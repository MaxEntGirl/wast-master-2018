They are <hi rend="underline">rich</hi> in mental vitamines &amp; calories. It was nice getting them from you &amp; also your Xmas card!</p> <p rend="indent">I'm in Swansea again over Christmas &amp; probably over New Year. The weather's foul. but I enjoy not being in Cambridge. I know quite a number of people here whom I like. I seem to find it more easy to get along with them here than in England. I feel much more often like smiling, e.g. when I walk in the street, or when I see children, etc. Just now I feel <hi rend="underline">very</hi> stupid. I ought to do some work but I don't. Last term my lectures didn't go too bad, on the whole. At the beginning of the term I thought I wouldn't be able to manage them. I felt a queer kind of exhaustion, sometimes coming on suddenly. Then a doctor prescribed me glucose &amp; that helped me enormously &amp; I was pretty fit afterwards.</p> <p rend="indent">I'll stop now. This letter's lousy, I know. But it's as good as I can do just now.</p> <p rend="indent">Good luck! Be good!</p> <p rend="indent">Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
