CAMB.</p> <p rend="right">27.8.47.</p> <p>Dear Norman,</p> <p rend="indent">Thanks for your letter which I received about 3 weeks ago. You know how much I enjoyed being with you at Cambridge. And, of course, you owe me <hi rend="underline">nothing</hi>. My mind is rather in a turmoil these days. I am almost certain that I shall resign my professorship in Autumn. I have not yet told Rollins, &amp; <hi rend="underline">please keep it to yourself</hi> as it's not yet certain. I <hi rend="underline">hate</hi> to let down Rollins &amp; Lazerovitz but I think I won't be able to help it. I'ld like to be alone somewhere &amp; try to write &amp; to make at least one part of my book publishable. I'll never be able to do it while I'm teaching at Cambridge. Also I think that, quite apart from writing, I need a longish spell of thinking <hi rend="underline">alone</hi>, without having to talk to anybody. But I haven't yet told the autorities about my plan &amp; I don't intend to do so until October when I'll decide definitely.</p> <p rend="indent">I wish you <hi rend="underline">all possible good luck</hi> &amp; I hope that I shall see you again one day! It was good to be with you! Give my warmest wishes to Lee &amp; say 'good luck' from me to Ray.</p> <p rend="indent">Let me hear from you!</p> <p rend="indent">Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> <p rend="indent">P.S. I'm going to Austria on Sept 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> until about Oct. 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. Trinity will always find me.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
