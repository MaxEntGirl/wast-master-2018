I then felt very lousy &amp; had queer attacks of exhaustion. Finally in despair I went to see a physician here in Cambridge who was known to me as quite a good &amp; conscientious man, but I felt sure that he couldn't really help me. Well, he advised me this &amp; that &amp; in the end he mentioned that I might try a Vitamin B preparation, as a deficiency in Vit. B sometimes had effects as the ones I had described to him. So, I took Vit. B. tablets, without the slightest hope that they'd help, &amp; to my great surprise they did help. I'm taking them regularly now &amp; I haven't had any more attacks of exhaustion. â€’ In fact, when I'm all tanked up with Vit. B I get so witty that the jokes get jammed &amp; can't came out. Isn't that terrible?</p> <p rend="indent">The weather's chilly &amp; damp, on the whole, &amp; when you come home you might bring a little heat from Sumatra with you. The mosquitos you can leave behind, except a few perhaps for my enemies.</p> <p rend="indent">I hope you'll come soon. Look after yourself.</p> <p rend="indent">God bless you!</p> <p rend="indent">So long!</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
