The title is "The Journals of George Fox" &amp; it had appeared in Dent's 'Everyman's Library'. If it wasn't out of print, Dents in London were to send it straight to you (with a X-mas card from me). I thought you mightn't have it &amp; that it might interest you. ‒ Towards the end of December I called again at the book shop &amp; was told that Dents had replied they couldn't send the book to America but that a firm, Dutton in New York, supplied America with the 'Everyman's Library'. I was told that they had already written to Dutton about it. By a mere chance I glanced into their ordre book &amp; I saw that <hi rend="underline">all</hi> the address they had put down was "D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Malcolm, Ithaca N.Y." ‒ I gave them a piece of my mind &amp; again your full address, &amp; they promised to write to Dutton immediately. ‒ <hi rend="underline">Did you get the book</hi>? ‒ I have no doubt, the card I gave the Dublin people was lost, so, even if you got the book, you couldn't have known who sent it.</p> <p rend="indent">I had a pretty good run of work in the last 3 months, or so, but I fell ill with some sort of infection of the intestines about 3 weeks ago &amp; it hasn't yet cleared up. If it goes on for another week I shall consult a specialist. Of course it hasn't done my work any good. I had to interrupt it completely for a week &amp; after that it just crawled along, as I do when I take a walk, these days.</p> <p rend="indent">I hope you're all well, or moderately well. It would be good to see you again before long!</p> <p rend="indent">Give my good wishes to Lee &amp; Raymond.</p> <p rend="indent">Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
