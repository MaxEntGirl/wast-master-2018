On the other hand I excuse you as there isn’t much to write about this place either. My work hasn’t been going very satisfactorily these last two months. My head was hardly ever as clear as I should have wished it to be. My discussion classes are going on all right. I wish I had you here. The other day I met Kapitza (I don’t know how you spell him) and we talked about you. He really is like a boy, quite likeable, but we haven’t anything in common to talk about.</p> <p rend="indent">Drury is going down at the end of this term (i.e. in a week’s time). I’m sorry to lose him. Inman is near Manchester in a settlement doing some kind of economical research. Lee is in the office of a coal mine (in England). I don’t hear much from them (they’re as lazy as you are). As I said, I should be glad to see you and talk about work with you, but, of course, there’s no chance.</p> <p rend="indent">Le me hear from you soon.</p> <p rend="right">Yours ever</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
