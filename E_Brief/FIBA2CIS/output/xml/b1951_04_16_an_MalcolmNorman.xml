Apart from a certain weakness which has constant ups &amp; downs I'm feeling <hi rend="underline">very</hi> well these days. My room here is much more agreable than the one in Oxford. Not that anyone could <hi rend="underline">possibly</hi> be kinder to me than Miss Anscombe was; &amp; I was very happy there, too, while I was ill. But now that I'm up the whole day I prefer it here. Thanks for sending me the book Kon-tiki. I've often heard of it &amp; it's bound to be interesting. ‒ I saw Moore twice recently &amp; had discussions with him. One very bad one, the other fairly good. I was responsible for the bad one's being bad. An extraordinary thing has happened to me. About a month ago I suddenly found myself in the right frame of mind for doing philosophy. I had been <hi rend="underline">absolutely</hi> certain that I'd never again be able to do it. It's the first time after more than 2 years that the curtain in my brain has gone up. ‒ Of course, so far I've only worked for about 5 weeks &amp; it may be all over by tomorrow; but it bucks me up a lot now.</p> <p rend="indent">I'm indoors most of the time, all the more as the weather is pretty rotten &amp; <hi rend="underline">very</hi> cold, but I can go out for short strolls. ‒ I want to go to Oxford before long to visit Smythies &amp; Bouwsma if all goes well with me.</p> <p rend="indent">Miss Anscombe sends her good wishes. Give my love to everybody.</p> <p rend="indent">Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> <p rend="indent">Remember me to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mooney. I like to think of her.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
