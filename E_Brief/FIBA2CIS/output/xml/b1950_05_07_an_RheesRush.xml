As you see I'm in Oxford. My room isn't very quiet &amp; I'm going into another room in the same house where it's supposed to be more quiet. I'm working a bit but my work's no good, &amp; I can't say that it is because of the noise. I'm just not in the right frame of mind; my work only mildly interests me; &amp; you can imagine what under these circumstances the stuff is like I'm writing down. ‒ I'm moderately well. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bevan in Cambridge wrote to a London specialist about me, giving him the history of my case up to the present time &amp; the expert replied that I might easily live for five more years. Nice prospect! Another year of this half-life would have been ample. ‒ I think I shall stay at Oxford for the present. If I had a hope of living a fuller life elsewhere I'd move. It was very kind of you to invite me to be your guest at Langland Hotel, but, apart from everything else, I wouldn't dream of letting you pay an expensive hotel for me. You haven't much money anyway. I <hi rend="underline">hope</hi> to come to Swansea again some day. I'd love going for walks there with you again. You'll hear from me again before long.</p> <p rend="right">L. Wittgenstein</p> <p rend="indent">The other day I read a book "The trials of Oskar Wilde". They are <hi rend="underline">very</hi> interesting, but <hi rend="doubleunderline">not at all</hi> nice.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
