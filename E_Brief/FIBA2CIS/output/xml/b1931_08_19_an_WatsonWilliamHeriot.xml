The truth is, I was exceedingly busy all the time and not quite well part of the time. I was in Norway for about 3 weeks (including journey) looking for a job for my lady friend. Now I'm back in Austria working in the country and wishing we had better weather, because the daily rain depresses me. My work makes moderately good progress. Thanks frightfully for the John O'London's Weekly. It's splendid and not only the article about philosophy but all the rest too. I hoped, in the beginning of the vac that I should be able to dictate part of what I had been writing in the last 3 years thereby getting it into a more final shape. But I can't yet as I've got to write such a lot of new stuf. It is very likely that I shan't lecture next Michaelmas term and use all the time to get nearer the end of my work. But I want to have private conversations with students if there are any who care to have them. I address this letter to McGill as I'm not sure whether your old Cambridge address would still reach you. Please let me hear from you, I shall be interested in everything you write to me and I shall always appreciate any nonsensical newspaper cuttings you send me.</p> <p rend="left">Yours</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
