As to whether or not we should accept Blacks offer, I want <hi rend="underline">you</hi> to decide. The only thing I'd like to say is, that <hi rend="underline">if</hi> we accept, this should not entail that I must see a great deal of him once I'm in Ithaca. Whether there is such an entailment you'll be able to judge far better than I. If there is, I'd rather go by rail, but in that case it would be madness of you to come all the long way from Ithaca to fetch me. I already have a ticket to Ithaca (which I can get refunded in case I don't use it). Also I don't yet know what <hi rend="underline">time</hi> the Queen Mary is supposed to arrive in New York, nor how far one can rely on the schedule. Supposing it arrived in the evening, could Black drive us back through the night, &amp; wouldn't it be <hi rend="underline">very</hi> disagreable for him? ‒ I'll wire you the time of arrival in a few days. ‒ This letter is probably frightfully stupid, but I can't write a more helpful one. My anaemia is as good as cured, but unfortunately I'm still not the same I was before I got ill. ‒ I'm looking forward immensely to seeing you &amp; Lee, &amp; I hope I shan't be too much trouble.</p> <p rend="indent">So long! &amp; good luck!</p> <p rend="indent">Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> <p rend="indent">P.S. <hi rend="underline">Whatever</hi> you decide will be OK by me.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
