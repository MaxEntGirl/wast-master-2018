I'm a <hi rend="underline">much</hi> worse correspondent than you are. I spent Christmas alone here, but on Boxing Day I saw two friends, one of whom had come over from England to see me &amp; stayed with me here for a few days. ‒ This is a pretty quiet place, &amp; if it were still more quiet it would suit me <hi rend="underline">still</hi> better. My work's going moderately well &amp; I think it might even go very well if I weren't suffering from some kind of indigestion which I don't seem to be able to shake off. I'll have to come to Ithaca &amp; eat your good cooking. ‒ Actually it's gradually getting better, &amp; my landlady here gives me all I need. ‒ I was a bit worried by what you write about Norman, that he's working so d... hard. Please tell him from me not to overdo it. I seriously admire his energy; but a man can only do <hi rend="underline">so much</hi>. ‒ Your lovely present has arrived. Thanks a lot! I'll now have enough to read for a whole year.</p> <p rend="indent">I think it's a <hi rend="underline">very</hi> good idea to make Ray read to you. To practice reading aloud <hi rend="underline">well</hi>, i.e. carefully, teaches one <hi rend="underline">a lot</hi>! E.g. how rotten &amp; slapdash most people, &amp; the newpapers, write; &amp; they write as they <hi rend="underline">think</hi>. I'm sure horses won't be bad company for Ray.</p> <p rend="indent">I heard from Shah &amp; Kreisel &amp; Hijab &amp; Hunt. Shah &amp; a few other students are having regular discussions in Shah's room, &amp; apparently they aren't too bad, &amp; some of the Moral Science Club meetings at which no Dons are present are tolerable, too.</p> <p rend="indent">I very much hope that some day I'll be able to be with you again &amp; to have talks with Norman.</p> <p rend="indent">My love to all of you! &amp; thanks again.</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> <p rend="indent">P.S. I've never heard of Rosenthal, which means nothing.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
