W.</p> <p rend="right">21 June 1919</p> <p>Dear Wittgenstein</p> <p rend="indent">Your letter reached me today, but your MS. has not come yet. It is true that what you dictated to Moore was not intelligible to me, &amp; he could give me no help. I think probably it is true that I shan't understand your MS till I see you, but it will be easier to get understanding from your talk if I have read the MS carefully first. At the moment, I could not get a passport to go abroad, but that won't last. I think probably it will be possible for us to meet at Christmas time, but it is not likely to be possible sooner.</p> <p rend="indent">I wrote only two post-cards, as I thought letters would not be allowed. But I wrote innumerable letters about you, trying to get greater freedom for you. They bore some slight fruit, but not as much as I hoped. I also wrote to your mother, but the letter was returned to me. ‒ Please don't be discouraged about my understanding your work. Throughout the war I did not think about philosophy, until, last summer, I found myself in prison, &amp; beguiled my leisure by writing a popular text-book, which was all I could do under the circumstances. Now I am back at philosophy, &amp; more in the mood to understand.</p> <p rend="indent">I shall read your MS the moment I get it, &amp; return it. What will be the address to which it is to be returned? All friendship &amp; affection from me to you. Don't be discouraged ‒ you will be understood in the end. Yours ever </p> <p rend="right">B. Russell.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
