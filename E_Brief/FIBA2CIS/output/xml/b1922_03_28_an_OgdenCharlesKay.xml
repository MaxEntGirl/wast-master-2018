Wechsel</p> <p rend="right">Nieder-Österreich</p> <p rend="right">28.3.22.</p> <p>Dear Ogden!</p> <p rend="indent">Thanks so much for your letter and the translation. I will retourn it as soon as I have correkted it which I hope will be not later than in one or two weeks. It could be done quicker but I haven't got a copy of the German here and will have to wait till a copy of my M.S. is sent to me from Vienna which will take a few daies. Now this brings me to a tremendous difficulty: I haven't got a <hi rend="doubleunderline">corrected</hi> copy of my book! ‒ The only corrected copy there is I gave to Russell. But what on earth has happened to that? From your letter I gather that you haven't got it. Has Ostwald got it then? But he obviously doesn't think of printing my stuff, otherwise it would have appeared long ago! I have never had a line from Ostwald about it. (In fact I think he doesn't know my address and I don't know his.) Now if Ostwald has got my M.S. the only thing would be to get it back from him in ordre to print the german text. There cann't be any good reason for letting him keep a M.S. which he will not publish. You will perhaps wonder w[h]y I don't sim[p]ly correkt the copy which I have got but this I probably won't be able to do. That is to say: I can of course correkt the spelling and rough mistakes, but the more subtle points of punctuation etc, which I have correkted in Ostwalds M.S. at a time when the matter was still alive in me, I can not correkt now. And, besides, there are some additions I wrote into that M.S. which I don't know and of which ‒ I think ‒ I have got no copy. For correcting <hi rend="underline">the translation</hi> my copy will do; for in the translation those more subtle points are lost at any rate. ‒ I have now read through the translation once and have seen from it that there must be some awfull faults in the german text the translators used. For the sense of some props is changed into the very reverse (of that I meant) in others it is destroied alltogether. However this can easily be mended! But as to the German text I realy don't know what to do. Please write to me as soon as you get this if you can get back my M.S. from Ostwald (<hi rend="tripleunderline">d ‒ him!</hi>) If not I will do my best to correkt my copy and send it to you. I would of course regrett <hi rend="doubleunderline">verry</hi> much if the german text was not printed in the english edition. ‒ And now, my temper has cooled down a little by underlining three times the above curse, I can express my best thanks to you and to the translators who have taken a trouble which the whole thing ‒ I'm affraid ‒ isn't worth. I am very sorry indeed I have to give you even more trouble yet for the reasons I mentioned. As to the translation I will retourn it to you with lots of notes which will enable you to find the wright expression in such doubtfull cases where I find the present expression wrong or awkward but am uncertain as to the correkt english expression; in other cases where I knew how to correkt the translation I have done it in the type written copy itself. In any case please look at all my correktions as I am never quite sure about english spelling ‒ etc. and I havn't even got a dictionary.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours sincerely</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> <p rend="indent">P.S. Is Johnson the logician still alive? If so, please remember me to him.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
