Draegni, Skiolden</p> <p rend="right">Sogn, Norway.</p> <p rend="right">29.10.13.</p> <p>Dear Russell,</p> <p rend="indent">I hope you have got my letter which I wrote on the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. I left it in the Dining room of the boat &amp; afterwards telefoned that it should be posted but I don't know with what effect. This is an ideal place to work in. ‒ Soon after I arrived here I got a violent influenza which prevented me from doing any work untill quite recently. Identity is the very Devil &amp; <hi rend="underline">immensely important</hi>; <hi rend="underline">very</hi> much more so than I thought. It hangs ‒ like everything else ‒ directly together with the most fundamental questions, especially with the questions concerning the occurence of the <hi rend="doubleunderline">same</hi> argument in different places of a function. I have all sorts of ideas for a solution of the problem but could not yet arrive at anything definite. However I don't loose courage &amp; go on thinking. I have got two nice rooms here in the Postmasters house &amp; am looked after very well indeed. By the way ‒ would you be so good &amp; send me <hi rend="underline">two</hi> copies of Moore's paper: "The Nature &amp; Reality of Objects of Perception" which he read to the Aristotelian Soc. in 1906. I am affraid I can't yet tel you the reason why I whant <hi rend="underline">two</hi> copies but you shall know it some day. If you kindly send the bill with them I will send the money immediately after receiving the Pamflets. ‒ As I hardly meet a soul in this place, the progress of my Norwegian is exceedingly slow; so much so that I have not yet learned a single swear word! Please remember me to Dr &amp; Mrs Whitehead &amp; Erik if you see them. Write to me <hi rend="multipleunderline">soon</hi>!</p> <p rend="indent">Yours as long as E!</p> <p rend="right">L. W.</p> <p rend="indent">P. S. How are your conversation-classes going on? Did you get the copy of my manuscript? I enclose a roseleaf as sample of the flora in this place.</p> <p rend="right">30.10.</p> <p rend="indent">I wrote this letter yesterday. Since then quite new ideas have come into my head: new problems have arrisen in the theory of molecular props &amp; the theory of inferrence has received a new &amp; very important aspect. One of the consequences of my new ideas will ‒ I think ‒ be that the whole of Logic follows from one P.p. only!! I cannot say more about it at present.</p> <p rend="right">L.
