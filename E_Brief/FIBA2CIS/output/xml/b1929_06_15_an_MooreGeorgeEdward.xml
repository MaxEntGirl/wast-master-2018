I therefore, in this letter, want to state again as clearly as I can my position, to guard against all possibilities of misinterpretation.</p> <p rend="indent">I am in the middle of a bit of research work which I don't want to break off as it seems to me hopefull. I possess all in all about 100 £ which will carry me through the vacations &amp; perhaps another month or two; but I mustn't use up all I've got, to leave some reserve for the time of looking round for a job. ‒ I therefore ask the College to grant me say 50 £ which would enable me to go on with my philosophical work till, at least, Xmass. If it should turn out, that in this time I have been able to produce good work ‒ as judged by anybody, the College would consider an expert in the matter ‒ and <hi rend="underline">if,</hi> further, I should feel capable of continuing my work with success, <hi rend="underline">then</hi> I propose to ask the College again for some sort of subvention.</p> <p rend="indent">Now Mr Butler asked me, how long, I thought, this might go on. ‒ I can't answer this question, because I don't know, how long I will be able to produce good work. (For all I know ‒ though I don't think it's likely ‒ I may cease tomorrow). But, I think, this question rests on a misunderstanding of what I realy want. Let me explain this: Supposing I was run over by a bus today &amp; then were to see my tutor &amp; say: "I'm now a cripple for lifetime, couldn't the College give me some money to suport me". Then it would be right to ask the question: "And how long do you propose this to go on, &amp; when will you be selfsuporting?" But this is <hi rend="underline">not</hi> my case. I propose to do work, &amp; I have a vague idea, that the College in some cases encourages such work by means of research grants, fellowships, etc. That's to say, I turn out some sort of goods &amp; <hi rend="underline">if</hi> the College has any use for these goods, I would like the College to enable me to produce them, as long as it <hi rend="underline">has</hi> use for them, &amp; as long as I <hi rend="underline">can</hi> produce them. ‒ If, on the other hand, the College has no use for them, that puts an end to the question.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours ever</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
