Her end was peaceful &amp; no shock to us as we had expected it for some days. ‒ I intend to stay here for another month. I'm in very good health. So much so that I even had a fairly good discussion with Miss Anscombe a few days ago. I'd be more use to you now than I was last summer in Ithaca. ‒ I'm glad to hear that Lee expects a baby. I <hi rend="underline">hope</hi> it won't be too difficult for Ray to get readjusted to the new situation; for in such a case the newcomer is apt to attract all affection &amp; the older boy feels out in the cold, rightly or wrongly. Don't tell Ray about this remark which <hi rend="underline">may</hi> have no application at all in his case. ‒ I can't say that Ryle's book worries me. Perhaps it ought to, but it doesn't. I was interested, however, in what you wrote about it. It tallied with what Smythies &amp; Miss Anscombe told me. ‒ I should like to have discussions with you now. Still, one can't have everything.</p> <p rend="indent">Give my love to Lee &amp; my good wishes to all those who don't mind getting them.</p> <p rend="indent">Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
