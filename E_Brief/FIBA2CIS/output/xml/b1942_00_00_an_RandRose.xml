Thank you – because I know you meant well. But you know that I don’t wish to get presents from you &amp; you should have respected my wish. When I got the book I debated with myself whether I should just send it back to you. I kept it, not because I wanted or needed it, but because sending it back seemed an unkind Thing to do, as I <hi rend="underline">knew</hi> you meant well. Another time I will send any present back, however much trouble this may give me; so, please, <hi rend="underline">stop</hi> sending me things. The money which you wrote you had received was not from me, by the way. – The reason I’m writing now, however, Isn’t to tell you all This but to say that to-morrow, Friday at 5 o.c. there will be a discussion in my room. If you should like to come, do. The discussion won’t be much good as I’m still weak.</p> <p rend="right">Yours sincerely </p> <p rend="right">L. Wittgenstein </p> </div> </div></body></text></TEI>
