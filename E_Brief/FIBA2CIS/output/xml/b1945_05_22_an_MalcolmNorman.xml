Had I had it before I saw you it would have made getting into contact with you rather easier. I worked (dictated) till one o.c. &amp; then remembered that I might still go to the station &amp; see you off. I looked at a time-table &amp; saw that there was a good train to London at exactly 1 o.c. &amp; no good train after that for some time. So I concluded you were taking the 1 o.c. train &amp; that I'ld be too late. Later Wisdom told me you had gone by a 1<hi rend="superscript">.50</hi> train â€’ which I could still have caught. I was sorry I didn't try for that one. I should have liked to have told you about getting your letter &amp; also to have repeated that I was glad to have seen you. I imagine there was a lot on <hi rend="underline">your</hi> mind as well as on mine when you were with me. If you write to me, as I hope you will, you might call me by my Christian name &amp; let me do the same. In case this should seem silly, or somehow wrong, to you, just say so frankly. I shan't be hurt.</p> <p rend="indent">Good luck! Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
