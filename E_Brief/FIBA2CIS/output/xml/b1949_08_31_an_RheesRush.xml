The chief reason was that most of the time I haven't been feeling well. There's something wrong with my arms. They hurt a great part of the day &amp; night. This has all sorts of nasty consequences. I've been to a doctor here; he says it's a neuritis &amp; may be caused by bad teeth (although I haven't got toothache). The trouble is, I'm a total stranger here &amp; have no way of finding out what doctor &amp; dentist can be trusted. So although I'm in bad shape, I may have to leave the whole thing until I come to England at the end of October.</p> <p rend="indent"><hi rend="underline">If</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Rhees can put me up then I could consult a doctor &amp; a dentist in London. I could go to Cambridge, but I don't know of any good doctor there. I'm doing some philosophy, but my work's no good. I have discussions with Malcolm &amp; some other people, &amp; sometimes they (the discussions) aren't too bad. There are some nice walks here though nothing compared with the gower coast. Nature here doesn't look as <hi rend="underline">natural</hi> as in Wales. The only thing I really enjoy here is the <hi rend="underline">engineering</hi>; that's superb. I like to see American machines. The people I've met were often very nice but mostly, though not always, very foreign to me.</p> <p rend="indent">When I come to England I hope to see you. Give my kind regards to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Rhees &amp; ask her about the end of October. My bout, the Queen Elizabeth, leaves New York on Oct. 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>.</p> <p rend="indent">All good wishes!!</p> <p rend="indent">So long!</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> <p rend="indent">Malcolm sends his kind regards.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
