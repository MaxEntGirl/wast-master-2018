The doctors have now made their diagnosis. I have cancer of the prostate. But this sounds, in a way, much worse than it is, for there is a drug (actually some hormones) which can, as I'm told, aleviate the symptoms of the disease, so that I can live on for years. The doctor even tells me that I may be able to work again, but I can't imagine that. I was in no way shocked when I heard I had cancer, but I <hi rend="underline">was</hi> when I heard that one could do something about it, because I had <hi rend="underline">no</hi> wish to live on. But I cou[l]dn't have my wish. I am treated with great kindness by every one &amp; I have an immensely kind doctor who isn't a fool either. I think of you &amp; Lee often with gratitude. Give my good wishes to Doney &amp; my love to Lee. Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
