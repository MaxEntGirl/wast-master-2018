You may not do it <hi rend="underline">exceedingly</hi> well, you may, at times do it badly, you may at times feel <hi rend="underline">very</hi> depressed about it, but this will be the case <hi rend="underline">whatever</hi> you do. I know it's none of my business &amp; you haven't asked my advice, but I can't help saying: please stick to your present job if it is at all possible. It's an honest job anyway &amp; it has 1000 advantages compared with teaching in a school, advantages which with very little imagination you can tell yourself.</p> <p rend="indent"><hi rend="underline">No</hi> job will ever <hi rend="underline">absolutly</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">entirely</hi> fit you (just as ready made clothes don't ever fit certain people). What I mean is: please beware of drifting between jobs but thank the Lord that you've found one which however moderately, fits you somewhat.</p> <p rend="indent">Forgive me for writing to you in this way.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
