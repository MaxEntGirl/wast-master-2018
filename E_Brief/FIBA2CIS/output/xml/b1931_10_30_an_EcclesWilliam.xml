But what about meeting in London. Don't you ever in the course of your business go there? Let me know if you do. Perhaps also we could meet when you are on your way to Russia. I am quite well &amp; very busy writing. As to the newspaper cutting: immagine, I opened your letter standing by the fireplace, the cutting dropped out &amp; straight into the fire, so that I don't know anything about it except what you write in your letter. ‒ I can quite immagine what it must be like to know that your old Coleraine home is broken up. I should feel the same if this happened to my parents house in Vienna. ‒ I should like to see your children again, especially Hugh. In my last letter I asked you to let me know some thing about Jim Bamber. <hi rend="underline">Please try to see him if you ever get to Manchester</hi> or write to him. I want to hear about him or from him. After all he was one of the very few people with whom I got on well during my Manchester periode.</p> <p rend="indent">Let me hear from you again &amp; whether there is any chance of seeing you in London (or Cambridge).</p> <p rend="indent">Yours ever</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> <p rend="indent">P.S. What you write about enjoying life 100% seems to me humbug. The above.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
