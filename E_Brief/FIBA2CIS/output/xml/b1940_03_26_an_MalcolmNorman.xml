I found them here today on returning from a week end excursion to Hastings. Thanks awfully! I'm sure they're grand. My critical eye can see that without having read them, because my critical eye is an X-ray eye &amp; can penetrate from 2 to 4000 pages. That's in fact how I got all my learning. Now please take it easy! One magazine a month is <hi rend="underline">ample</hi>. If you send me more I won't have time to do any philosophy. Also please don't waste your money on mags for me, &amp; see that <hi rend="underline">you</hi> get enough to eat! I'm glad to say Smythies has got unconditional exemption. I shall give him your regards when I see him tomorrow &amp; as I know that he'll send you his I give them to you right now. My lectures have gone moderately well this term &amp; I hope they won't be too awful next term. I'm feeling a bit run down just now. I'm extremely glad that you've found kind people to stay with. I wish you lots of good &amp; decent thoughts.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
