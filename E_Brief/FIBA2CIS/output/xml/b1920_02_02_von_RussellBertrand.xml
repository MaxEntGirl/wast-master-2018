I waited to begin writing the introduction until I knew you had a publisher, since the introduction would have had to be quite different if it had been written for publication in England. I will get it done as soon as I possibly can, but I do not think it can be finished for another six weeks. You may, however, absolutely count upon it, and tell your publishers so.</p> <p rend="indent">I am very sorry to hear you have been ill.</p> <p rend="indent">I do not go back to Cambridge until October.</p> <p rend="indent">Keynes, as you may have heard, has written a book of the very greatest importance on the economic consequences of the peace. It is having a great effect upon opinion here, and is likely to do much good.</p> <p rend="indent">I loved our time together at the Hague, and was very happy, both in seeing you and in our discussions.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours ever,</p> <p rend="right">Bertrand Russell</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
