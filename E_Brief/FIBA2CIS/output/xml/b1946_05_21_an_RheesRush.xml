I was glad to hear that they had the sense to offer you an appointment again at Swansea. I wish to God you'ld take it!! I don't know, of course, what your special reasons are for wanting to leave Swansea, but <hi rend="underline">please</hi> weigh them damn carefully. I should, for personal reasons, <hi rend="underline">hate</hi> you to leave Swansea. Our talks &amp; discussions have done me good. <hi rend="underline">Don't stupidly throw away an opportunity of doing some good</hi>. Your derogatory remarks about your philosophical abilities &amp; success are so much rubbish. <hi rend="underline">You are all right</hi>. And I mean just that: nothing more &amp; nothing less. ‒ Philosophical influences <hi rend="underline">much worse</hi> than yours &amp; mine are spreading rapidly, &amp; it's <hi rend="underline">important</hi> that you should stay at your job. That your success won't be brilliant is certain; in fact it will be meagre, it's bound to be. Please, if you possibly can, resign yourself to it &amp; stay on. ‒ Don't misunderstand me. I'm not trying to appear wise. I'm just as silly as you are. But that doesn't make you any less silly.</p> <p rend="indent">So long!</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> <p rend="indent">P.S. Read this letter again from the beginning.</p> <p rend="indent">Good wishes!</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
