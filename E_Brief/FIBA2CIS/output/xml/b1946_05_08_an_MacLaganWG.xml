He came to them for two or three years &amp; during that time &amp; in all the following years we had innumerable philosophical discussions, as well as conversations on ever so may other subjects. He has become a close personal friend of mine.</p> <p rend="indent">He has an excellent grasp of philosophical problems &amp; is keenly interested in a great variety of philosophical subjects - including moral &amp; political philosophy about which he has thought a great deal &amp; is, I believe, extremely well read.</p> <p rend="indent">He investigates philosophical problems in a fruitful way, i.e., a way which promises definite progress, as opposed to a mere moving in circles.</p> <p rend="indent">I am certain that he is as good a teacher as could be found - most conscientious, taking great personal interest in the welfare of his students, indefatigable, patient &amp; patient in discussion.</p> <p rend="indent">That he has not published philosophical writings ought not, in my opinion, to count against him. His reluctance to publish is not due to a lack of fruitful thoughts but to a very rare amount of self-criticism.</p> <p rend="indent">Mr Rhees has a very exceptional character. He is kindly, most serious, conscientious to a fault, - an excellent colleague &amp; friend.</p> <p rend="indent">Any Philosophical Department should be proud of having him amongst its members.</p> </div> <div type="salute" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"> <p rend="indent">Yours sincerely, </p> <p rend="indent">L.Wittgenstein </p> </div> </div></body></text></TEI>
