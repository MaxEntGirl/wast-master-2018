Newcastle</p> <p rend="right">9.2.44</p> <p>Dear Rhees,</p> <p rend="indent">Thanks so much for your letter &amp; wish. I intend to go to Cambridge about the middle of next week &amp; I should like to leave there as soon as possible. There may possibly be one catch. You know I am on leave of absence here &amp; it has been granted me because I am doing "important" war work. If, e.g., I leave here &amp; try to find another job, say in a hospital, I have to let the General Board know &amp; they have to approve the new job. Now if I come to Cambridge next week they'll want to know what I'm doing &amp; I'll have to tell them that I want to do some philosophy for a couple of months. And in this case they can say: if you want to do philosophy you're not doing a war job &amp; have to do your philosophy in Cambridge. I'm awfully sorry that I haven't thought of this before. It only dawned upon me today. Not for any particular reason. I just thought of it. A few days ago I wrote to Broad asking if I could stay in College for a few days &amp; telling him the reason. I've not yet had a reply &amp;, perhaps, when I get it he'll write something about this business. I imagine I could say I need a rest &amp; take a two months holiday. I just don't know what the University does in such a case &amp; shall have to see next week. I'm almost shure that I <hi rend="underline">couldn't</hi> work at Cambridge now! I <hi rend="doubleunderline">hope</hi> I'll be able to come to Swansea. ‒ Drury is in Swansea now &amp; perhaps you've already seen him. Thanks again for your great kindness!</p> <p rend="indent">So long!</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
