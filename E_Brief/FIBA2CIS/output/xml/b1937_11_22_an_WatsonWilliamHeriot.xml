I've been in Norway for the last 16 months with interruptions, living in a little house I had built for myself before the war. I came here to think and write and not to be disturbed. I don't know however if my book will appear during my lifetime. I have an idea it won't.</p> <p rend="indent">I'm pleased to hear you've published a book. But I needn't tell you 1 shan't read it. For a) I wouldn't understand it and b) I hardly read anything at all (practically nothing.) As to the preface and your mention of me, it's nice of you, you did it and I'm sure you did it in a kind way, so I needn't see that either. I haven't read Waissman's book and I'm not going to. I'm glad you found it clear and interesting - Braithwaite too has written a book, 1 hear. I'm sure it's damn bad, without having seen it. I intend to stay here for another 3 weeks and then to go to Vienna for Christmas and after Christmas to England. I haven't seen Prof. Moore since I saw him last in August, but I hear he's all right.</p> <p rend="indent">I dare say this'll reach you about Christmas, so the best I can do is to wish you a happy Christmas and New Year.</p> <p rend="indent">Do write to me again before too long. Trinity College will always find me. I hope I shall see you again some time.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours ever</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
