I wish I knew more about military matters. I can't understand e.g., what a psychologist has to do with your medical category in the Army. Surely there's nothing wrong with you <hi rend="underline">mentally</hi>! (Or if there is the psychologist won't know it.) One thing seems to me clear. If, as it seems, you can't get a commission (at least not <hi rend="underline">now</hi>) &amp; if, for whatever reason, they don't put you into a lab. or theater, then the only thing for you to do is to do the job <hi rend="underline">which you've got</hi> <hi rend="underline">really</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">well</hi>; so well that you don't lose your self-respect in doing it. For <hi rend="underline">every</hi> job can be done really well. I don't know if you understand me. It is an intelligent thing to do to use whatever means one has to get a better, or more suitable job. <hi rend="underline">But</hi> if those means fail then there comes a moment when it no longer makes sense always to complain &amp; to kick, but when you've got to <hi rend="underline">settle down</hi>. You're like a man who moves into a room &amp; sais "oh, this is only temporary" &amp; doesn't unpack his trunks. Now this is all right ‒ for a time. But if he <hi rend="underline">can't</hi> find a better place, or <hi rend="underline">can't</hi> make up his mind to risk moving perhaps into another town altogether, then the thing to do is to unpack his trunks &amp; settle down whether the room's good or not. For <hi rend="doubleunderline">anything</hi>'s better than to live in a state of waiting. Three years in a hospital in India might be hell, &amp; I hope to God that won't be your lot, but this war <hi rend="underline">will</hi> end, &amp; the most important thing is what sort of a person <hi rend="underline">you</hi>'ll be when it's over. That's to say: when it's over you ought to be a <hi rend="doubleunderline">man</hi>. And you won't be if you don't train yourself now. The first thing to do is: stop kicking when it's fruitless. It seems to me you ought either apply to be posted somewhere nearer the front &amp; just <hi rend="underline">risk</hi> it, or, if you don't want to do that, <hi rend="underline">sit down</hi> where you are, don't think of moving but only of doing that work well which you've got <hi rend="underline">now</hi>. ‒ I'll be quite frank with you &amp; say that I think it <hi rend="underline">might</hi> be better for you not to be within reach of your family. Your family is, of course, soothing, but it may also have a softening effect. And for certain sores you want to make the skin <hi rend="underline">harder</hi>, not softer. I mean, I have an idea (perhaps it's as wrong as hell) that your family makes it more difficult, or impossible, for you to settle down &amp; get down to your work without looking right or left. Also you should perhaps look a little more inside you, &amp; this also is perhaps impossible with your family around. In case you show this letter to Lotte &amp; she wildly disagrees with me I'll say this: maybe she wouldn't be a good wife if she didn't disagree, but that doesn't mean that what I tell you mayn't be <hi rend="underline">true</hi>!</p> <p rend="indent">Good wishes, as always.</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
