They were forwarded to me to Vienna and had to be sent to Hallein near Salzburg where I am staying just now with an onkle of mine. So they just arrived the day before yesterday.</p> <p rend="indent">I have looked through carefully all your notes and made my remarks where it was necessary. But as there was not sufficient room to explain myself in the margin I wrote them on a separate sheet which you will find enclosed.</p> <p rend="indent">I then read through <hi rend="underline">the whole of the German text</hi> and of course found a good many faults which I corrected on the proof itself without mentioning them on a separate sheet. I hope theese corrections are all of them intelligible. Several faults were made in separating sylables in german words when <hi rend="underline">one</hi> half of the word stands on one line the other half on the next.</p> <p rend="indent">Now there was one difficulty in correcting the German: I havn't got my manuscript here. Therefore it often happened that I was not quite sure whether the text was right or wrong. <hi rend="underline">Now in such cases I put a sign such ← to the line in which I suspect a fault or about which I am not quite certain at any rate and the arrow means: "please look up this line in the original and see if it's right</hi>!" Especially it often happened that I was not sure about the <hi rend="underline">punctuation</hi> in this case I put a sign "P←" before the line. So please compare the punctuation in these lines carefully with that of the original. Of course the arrow <hi rend="underline">doesn't</hi> <hi rend="underline">mean</hi> <hi rend="underline">that there is a fault</hi> <hi rend="underline">but it just means that I'm not quite certain if there is or not</hi>. In cases where I could easily explain my doubts I wrote some quearies in the margin which ‒ please ‒ examine carefully.</p> <p rend="indent">As to your note about the Italian monastery etc. etc., do as you please; only I cann't for my life see the point of it. Why should the general reviewer know my age? Is it as much as to say: You cann't expect more of a young chap especially when he writes a book in such a noise as must have been on the Austrian front? If I knew that the general reviewer believed in astrology I would suggest to print the date and hour of my birth in front of the book that he might set <hi rend="underline">the horoscope</hi> for me. (26/IV 1889. 6 p.m)</p> <p rend="indent">I look forward very much to see Russell the day after tomorrow in Innsbruck. My address is as usual: L. W. bei Frau Mima Sjögren XIII. St. Veitgasse 17, Wien.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours sincerely</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> <p rend="indent">2.0123 If it isn't unenglish leave "know". It is used here in the sense in which one says "I know this man". If you <hi rend="underline">will</hi> put "am acquainted" for it the prop must run thus: "If I am acquainted with an object, then I also know all its..." that means in the second occurrence there must be "<hi rend="underline">know</hi>". "To know" means both: <hi rend="underline">kennen</hi> and <hi rend="underline">wissen</hi> and "to be acquainted with" ‒ I think ‒ hasn't exactly the meaning I want, because it seems to me to imply somehow that one knows a lot about an object, while to know here just means: I know <hi rend="underline">it</hi> but I needn't know anything <hi rend="underline">about</hi> it.</p> <p rend="indent">2.01231 As above: In the first occurrence you might put "be acquainted with", in the second leave "know".</p> <p rend="indent">2.02331. I don't think "without trouble" is good. I think the word "strai[gh]t away" has the right meaning. It would then run: "...one can distinguish it strai[gh]t away from the others by...".</p> <p rend="indent">2.06 Yes, this prop. means "Reality is the existence and nonexistence of atomic facts". But couldn't we leave it as it is with "the"? I think it suits the precedent prop. better. But do as you like about it.</p> <p rend="indent">2.181 Put "a"</p> <p rend="indent">3.203 If you put the full stop after "meaning" there must be one in the bracket too.</p> <p rend="indent">3.261 Put: "Nor any sign which..."</p> <p rend="indent">3·326 I think "significant" is alright here. The meaning of this prop. is: that in order to recognize the symbol in a sign we must look at how this sign is <hi rend="underline">used significantly</hi> in propositions. I.e. we must observe how the sign is used in accordance with the laws of logical syntax. Thus "significant" here means as much as "syntactically correct".</p> <p rend="indent">3.331 No, this isn't meant imperatively. Put "into" for "to".</p> <p rend="indent">3.34. <hi rend="underline">Did I underline "welche allein" in the German</hi>?! <hi rend="underline">If so, it ought to be gesperrt</hi>. If not, I don't know what was in my head when I underlined the English. If I didn't underline <hi rend="underline">the German</hi> don't put italics in the English.</p> <p rend="indent">4.041 You might put "get outside it" instead of "get away from it".</p> <p rend="indent">4.0411 In the 3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> line leave out brackets in "Gen. fx". "Determine" <hi rend="underline">does</hi> mean something like <hi rend="underline">discover</hi> here. We cann't distinguish between the two variables, we cann't <hi rend="underline">find out</hi> which is which.</p> <p rend="indent">4.0621. Couldn't the two "~" in "(~~p=p)" be printed slightly nearer together? In the German they are a little nearer. They could allways be as close together as the "~" is to "p". There needn't be a biger space between "~" and "~" than between "~" and "p".</p> <p rend="indent">4.112 If "to make" is better, please put it in. The whole, of course, is a Zeugma and there ought to be a substantive after "but" to match with "a number of...". But I suppose that cann't be done.</p> <p rend="indent">4.1273 See proof: "aRb", "(∃x) : aRx.xRb", "(∃x,y) : aRx.xRy.yRb" are quite separate symbols they must therefore be slightly further apart from one another.</p> <p rend="indent">4.4 Omit "the".</p> <p rend="indent">4.465 "essence" is alright</p> <p rend="indent">4.466 leave "symbols"</p> <p rend="indent">5.02 It realy ought to be "+<hi rend="subscript">c</hi>" not "<hi rend="superscript">+</hi>c". "c" is a suffix"</p> <p rend="indent">5.101 Put: "p. ~q : ∨ : q. ~p"</p> <p rend="indent">In the first line of the schema there should be square brackets round p ⊃ p . q ⊃ q. It doesn't matter that they are not square in the German. In the last line of the schema the round brackets want closing and there must be a bigger space between them and the square ones, just as in the top line. In the bottom line in the German please put "(p . ~p . q. ~q)" instead of "(p. ~p . ~q. q)"</p> <p rend="indent">5.1361 Don't print "Superstition" in italics! But leave the German "Aberglaube" gesperrt.</p> <p rend="indent">5.1362 "known" is alright here.</p> <p rend="indent">5.155 Put "unit". Oughtn't there to be a <hi rend="underline">colon</hi> in the first line of this prop. before the capital "The" at the end of the line as in the German before "Die Umstände..."?</p> <p rend="indent">5.3 Omit "the".</p> <p rend="indent">5.42 The last part of this prop ought to run: "And it is obvious that the "⊃" which we define by means of "~" and "∨" is identical with that by w[h]ich we define "∨" with the help of "~" and that this "∨" is the same as the first, and so on." Thus your correction in the German is quite right only in the last case there ought to be "∨" instead of "~" in the German and in the English.</p> <p rend="indent">5.473 <hi rend="underline">I believe it ought to be "some" here</hi>. One might say in a similar sense: "the prop. is senseless because <hi rend="underline">there is <hi rend="doubleunderline">some</hi> arbitrary determination which we have not made". I hope you can leave it as it is.</hi></p> <p rend="indent">5.511 I suppose it should be "connected <hi rend="underline">into</hi>". <hi rend="underline">I didn't mean</hi> "connected with" <hi rend="underline">but</hi>: connected to one another in such a way as to form an infinitely fine network. Could one say "I connect these bits of string into a network" meaning, I connect them in such a way as to form a network?</p> <p rend="indent">5.521 I mean "separate" and <hi rend="underline">not</hi> "derive". They were connected and I separate them.</p> <p rend="indent">5.5261 <hi rend="underline">"(∃x, ϕ) etc" not "(∃x. ϕ) etc".</hi></p> <p rend="indent">The bracket schould stand at the end of the prop..</p> <p rend="indent">Put "A characteristic of a composite symbol..." as you suggested.</p> <p rend="indent">5.5303 Yes, this schould be "Roughly speaking:"</p> <p rend="indent">5.532 In the German in should be "...; und nicht...</p> <p rend="indent">5.5563 "image" has the meaning of "simile" here. So you <hi rend="underline">may</hi> put "simile".</p> <p rend="indent">6.121 "into" is right.</p> <p rend="indent">6.36111 The figure schould be thus</p> <p rend="indent">-----o—x-----x—o-----</p> <p rend="indent"> a b</p> <p rend="indent">I.e. the little cross and the circle should be just at the end of each line and not at a distance from it [x<hi rend="superscript">↙</hi>——<hi rend="superscript">↘</hi>o] and they should be quite small; for they should just mark that the two ends of each line are different.</p> <p rend="indent">4.1272 Look at my correction. <hi rend="underline">Here the commas and quotation marks are printed wrongly</hi>! It mustn't be "'<hi rend="underline">Complex,' 'Fact,' etc etc</hi>" <hi rend="underline">but</hi>: "'Complex', 'Fact', 'Function', 'Number', etc" Similar nonsense you find above in the same prop.! And in the German too. Please note this point when you look through the stuff again.</p> <p rend="indent">4.1273 In the 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> line from the top of this prop.: Is there a comma wanted after "series", and ought it to be between the word and the quotation marks?</p> <p rend="indent">4.24 In the German exactly as in the English:</p> <p rend="indent">"'fx', 'ϕ(x,y)', etc." in the English</p> <p rend="indent">"'fx', 'ϕ(x,y)', etc" in the German.</p> <p rend="indent">4.241 I wonder what has got into the printers head!</p> <p rend="indent">4.1252 The same faults. <hi rend="underline">In the German it is alright</hi>.</p> <p rend="indent">4.0411        "        "        "</p> <p rend="indent">4.441        "        "        "</p> <p rend="indent">4.442        "        "        " If possible don't separate (TTFT) from (p,q) they ought to stand on the same line. The space between them should not be biger than it is in the German.</p> <p rend="indent">5.02        "        "        " (First line)</p> <p rend="indent">There is a fault in the translation of this prop. caused perhaps by a misprint in the German. It must not be: "The index is always part of a description of the object <hi rend="underline">whose names we attach to it</hi>..." <hi rend="underline">but</hi>: "...of the object <hi rend="underline">to whose name we attach it</hi>...".
