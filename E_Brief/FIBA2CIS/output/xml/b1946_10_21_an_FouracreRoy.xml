My lectures go as usual, not too bad. There are too many people coming to them, also as usual at the beginning of every academic year. I'm in very good health, except just now for a cold. I'm thinking <hi rend="underline">every day</hi> of retiring from my job &amp; taking on something else which might bring me into a more human contact with my fellowmen. But <hi rend="underline">what</hi> I'll do God knows! for I'm already a pretty old codger. ‒ I hope you'll come back soon from that bl..... Sumatra, or wherever you are. Not that it's nice in Europe! ‒ At this moment I got your letter of Oct. 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. Why, in Hell, you don't get my letters beats me! Do you think the censor keeps them as souvenirs because they are so marvelous? I shouldn't be surprised! ‒ Well, for Gods sake, finish your tours to South Sumatra &amp; to Central Sumatra &amp; take a plane (I don't mean the sort a joiner uses) &amp; get home.</p> <p rend="indent">The weather here isn't too bad just now &amp; not yet cold.</p> <p rend="indent">Look after yourself, &amp; God bless you!</p> <p rend="indent">As always,</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
