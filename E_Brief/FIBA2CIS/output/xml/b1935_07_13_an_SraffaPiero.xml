I think you said that you had the stuff with you in Russia. Also please let me know where one can get it, if you happen to know. – </p> <p rend="indent">I said to you today that I would write to you sometime, but in fact I think that it wouldn’t be quite natural for me to write to you; unless one day I see clearly that you were right in the essential points of our conversations, or, if I should ever see clearly that you were wrong. All I can now say is this: that there is <hi rend="underline">something</hi> fundamentally wrong with me. – if a layman with healthy eyes looks at a bad portrait he sees that it is bad &amp; will often tell you straightaway <hi rend="underline">what</hi> is wrong in it, in his opinion; he will insist, say, that the nose is too long. The painter can then safely take it from him that the portrait is bad; but he would as a rule be ill advised to shorten the nose. For it is one thing to see that a picture is bad, &amp; an entirely different thing to see where the fault lies. – Thus, when you look into me you see that here is something wrong – &amp; I agree – but whether in showing what is wrong you point to the right spot is very doubtfull, – &amp; perhaps not really relevant, as it is my job anyway to do something to put it right. Let us hope that this shall really be done &amp; that one day I shall feel allright. Yours </p> <p rend="indent">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div> </div></body></text></TEI>
