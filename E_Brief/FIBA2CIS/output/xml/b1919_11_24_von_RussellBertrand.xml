It seems not impossible that ‒ we may not be both able to get visas. If I fail, I will wire to you the one word "impossible". In that case, we shall have to wait till Easter, &amp; then meet in Switzerland. I shall be <hi rend="underline">very</hi> sorry if that happens. But I find (what I didn't know) that Switzerland is much easier to get to than Holland. ‒ Jolley, at Cambridge, offers £80 for your furniture, not including the books. If I go back to Cambridge, which I may do, I should probably be glad to take your furniture, or part of it. Would it suit you if I paid you £100 for the furniture &amp; books (not including any special books that you might want returned) &amp; then I could arrange with Jolley what I wanted to keep. I don't know whether it is legally possible to pay you yet, but I will find out. You would have to write to</p> <p rend="indent">B. Jolley &amp; Sons, Bridge Str. Camb.</p> <p rend="indent">to say you had sold the furniture &amp; books to me &amp; they were to deal with me.</p> <p rend="indent">Please let me know as soon as you possibly can whether you can get your visa. It will be a very great disappointment if we have to put off meeting till the spring.</p> <p rend="indent">Yrs ever</p> <p rend="right">Bertrand Russell.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
