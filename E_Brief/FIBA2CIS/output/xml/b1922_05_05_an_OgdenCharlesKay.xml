There can be no thought of printing them. What they contain is this: When I had finished the book <hi rend="underline">roughly</hi> there remained certain props ‒ about a hundred ‒ about which I was doubtful whether I should take them in or not. These props were ‒ partly ‒ different versions of t[h]ose now contained in the book; for it had often happened that I had written down a prop in many different forms, when the same thought had occurred to me in different ways during the long time I worked at that business. Another part of the supplements are merely sketches of props which I thought I might some day take up again if their thoughts should ever revive in me. That means: The supplements are exactely what must <hi rend="underline">not</hi> be printed. Besides <hi rend="doubleunderline">they realy contain no elucidations at all</hi>, but are still less clear than the rest of my props. As to the shortness of the book I'm <hi rend="underline">awfully sorry for it; but what can I do</hi>?! If you were to squeeze me out like a lemon you would get nothing more out of me. To let you print the Ergänzungen would be no remedy. It would be just as if you had gone to a joiner and ordered a table and he had made the table to short and now would sell you the shavings and sawdust and other rubish along with the table to make up for its shortness. (Rather than print the Ergänzungen to make the book fatter leave a dozen of white sheets for the reader to swear intoo when he has purchased the book and cann't understand it.)</p> <p rend="indent">The title of the book must ‒ I think ‒ be printed twice: Once in front of the whole book and then again before my preface (as you suggested). Thus the succession would be:</p> <p> <table> <row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"> <cell cols="3" role="data" rows="1"><hi rend="underline">Title</hi> (only English)</cell> </row> <row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"> <cell cols="3" role="data" rows="1"><hi rend="underline">Russell</hi><hi rend="underline">'s Introduction</hi></cell> </row> <row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"> <cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><hi rend="underline">Title</hi> (again)</cell> <cell rows="4" role="data" cols="1"><hi rend="font-size:400%">}</hi></cell> <cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1">(in the english as well as in the translation)</cell> </row> <row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"> <cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><hi rend="underline">Dedication Motto</hi></cell> <cell rows="3" role="data" cols="1">This is the part I am responsible for and therefore must be left together</cell> </row> <row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"> <cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><hi rend="underline">Preface</hi></cell> </row> <row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"> <cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><hi rend="underline">No 1 etc</hi>.</cell> </row> </table> </p> <p rend="indent">I was very interested to hear that Johnson's book has appeared (I like Johnson <hi rend="underline">very</hi> much.) And I should like to see his book. Perhaps it will be possible someday. ‒ So don't be angry that I cannot make my book biger. I would if I could.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours sincerely</p> <p rend="right">L. Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
