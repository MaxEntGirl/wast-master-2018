Until about a week ago I hardly did any &amp; what work I did wasn't any good. I cann't imagine what could have been the matter with me, but I felt both extremely excitable &amp; uncapable of sticking to any thought. It may have been some sort of tiredness or the climat, for we had a terrible hot southwind blowing allmost all the time which has a bad effect on many people. However I hope it's over now, I'm in the country again since about 10 days, in the same place where I was last year &amp; I'm quite alone at present. ‒ I have received the £50 from Trinity. My life now is very economical, in fact as long as I'm here there is no possibility of spending any money. I hope you're getting on all right.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours ever</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
