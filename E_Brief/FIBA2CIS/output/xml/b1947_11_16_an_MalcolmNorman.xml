CAMB.</p> <p rend="right">16.11.47.</p> <p>My dear Norman,</p> <p rend="indent">As soon as I returned here from Austria I tendered my resignation to the Vice Chancellor &amp; I shall cease to be professor on Dec. 31<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>.<hi rend="superscript"> at 12 p.m.</hi> <hi rend="underline">Whatever</hi> happens to me (&amp; I'm not at all sanguine about my future) I feel I did the only natural thing. I intend to leave here for Ireland in about 3 weeks. I don't know what my address will be, but "Trinity Coll. Cambridge" will always find me. I'm <hi rend="underline">very</hi> busy these days; chiefly, dictating stuff I wrote during the last 2-3 years. It's mostly <hi rend="doubleunderline">bad</hi> but I want to have it with me in a handy form. â€’ I'm seeing Moore once a week. I like being with him almost more than ever. Somehow we seem to understand each other better. He is alternately well &amp; a little ill &amp; has to take it easy.</p> <p rend="indent">I'll write more some time soon. Just now I'm always in a hurry. Give my warmest wishes to Lee &amp; Raymond. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Good luck</hi>!</p> <p rend="indent">Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> <p rend="indent">I had an impertinent letter from Lazerovitz reproaching me for not letting him know beforehand about my resignation. He told me that this showed a 'shocking' 'fault of character' &amp; that I was 'a gross person'. I replied &amp; tried to tell him 'where he gets off'. He <hi rend="underline">seems</hi> to be an ass.</p> <p rend="indent">So long! Let me hear from you before long!</p> <p rend="right">The above.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
