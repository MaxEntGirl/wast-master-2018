I'm feeling much better now than I did a month ago. I have hardly any pain. The improvement is probably due to the deep x-ray treatment I took for a few weeks. (This time it wasn't my shoulders but my spine that got the rays). I am of course very weak &amp; there seems no doubt that this isn't going to change for the better as time goes on. I hardly think that I'll be on this earth when you come to Cambridge in Autumn '52. Still, one doesn't know.</p> <p rend="indent">I am not depressed in the least, by the way. ‒ I'm very glad you liked the Rommel book. I looked at it quite recently again &amp; was impressed again by the thoroughly <hi rend="underline">decent</hi> way in which it's written. Such books are few &amp; far between. The author, where he disagrees with other people of high rank (as on p.p. 160-161), expresses himself very cautiously, but one always knows what he thinks &amp; what he would say if he could let himself go. ‒ I can see that the question of what to do with Ray while you're in England is serious &amp; I can't suggest anything at all. But there's still plenty of time to think about it. I'm glad that v. Wright proposed you. He told me about it a few weeks ago. ‒ In a way it might be good to bring Ray to Europe (though not to enter him in a school) because it might open his eyes. But on the other hand it might shut them, &amp; so I just don't know at all. ‒ I saw Moore yesterday &amp; we talked philosophy. But it was no good because I was far too dull &amp; hazy. When I'm alone I am sometimes a bit brighter. ‒ The other day I saw a laudatory review of two philosophical books in the "New Statesman". One was by a man Toulmin, who come to my classes while you were in Cambridge, I think; the other seemed to contain articles by Wisdom, Waismann, Ryle &amp; other charlatans. The review I read particularly praised one remark of Waismann's which came straight out of my lectures. I'd like to see a review some day which debunks these people.</p> <p rend="indent">Give my love to Lee &amp; all my best wishes to everybody who can make use of them.</p> <p rend="indent">Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
