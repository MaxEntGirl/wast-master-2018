Laziness was one cause but another was that I'm not feeling well. I get queer states of mental exhaustion which are <hi rend="underline">very</hi> terrifying. I've had two lectures so far. There's a crowd coming to them as always at the beginning of the year when they don't know what to expect. Still my lectures went quite well, except for the fact that during my second lecture I sometimes got so exhausted that I could hardly speak. But my brain, oddly enough, was very active. What's to become of it all I don't know. I plan to see a doctor (<hi rend="underline">not</hi> a psychologist) about it, hoping, <hi rend="underline">completely</hi> against hope, that he can advise me something. I dislike this place intensely, &amp; the worst part of it is that I haven't got a <hi rend="underline">real</hi> friend here, i.e., someone who'ld go out of his way to do something for me.</p> <p rend="indent">I saw Moore a week ago for a short time. He had recently been ill (heart trouble) &amp; looked aged, but his interest in philosophy was as lively &amp; agreable as ever. I gave him your good wishes &amp; he is returning them (or rather, not the identical ones but exactly similar ones).</p> <p rend="indent">Drury is in Dublin, studying for his M.D.: I wish he were nearer here. I believe he'll return to England about Christmas.</p> <p rend="indent">Malcolm is here &amp; very seriously studying. He is having a discussion with me once a week. He is a decent &amp; serious man.</p> <p rend="indent">May God help me, &amp; may I be able to come to Swansea at Christmas as usual.</p> <p rend="indent">Let me hear from you before long!</p> <p rend="indent">As always,</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
