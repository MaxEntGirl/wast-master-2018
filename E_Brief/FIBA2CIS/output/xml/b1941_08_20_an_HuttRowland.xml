I wrote to you a few days ago explaining why I hadn't written sooner. ‒ I never had any particulary book in mind when I wrote to you: would you like me to send you a book; &amp; as in your reply you didn't mention any particular book. I took it that you didn't want me to send you one. I expected you to suggest a book if you wanted one.</p> <p rend="indent">About the 'Imitation' you're wrong. I've never read the book nor did I take it to Russia. I believe you're mixing it up with Tolstoy's 'Short explanation of the gospels'.</p> <p rend="indent">I hope I shall see you when you're on leave &amp; I <hi rend="underline">hope</hi> it'll be good for both of us! I wonder what the surprise is you mention in your letter. Is it by any chance a mustache or beard that you've been growing? I hope it isn't. For I don't like people to change their faces; par[t]icularly when they are liable to change their souls! ‒ To return to the book question: I don't know What book might be 'good for you'. You once mentioned that you had read in the 'Pilgrim's Progress' &amp; enjoyed it. If you like I could send you that. Let me know. ‒ Francis' leg is steadily improving &amp; so is mine.</p> <p rend="indent">As to your letters I should like to say this: <hi rend="underline">one word</hi> that comes from your heart would mean more to me than 3 pages out of your head!</p> <p rend="indent">Good wishes as always!</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
