I deposited the things (two parcels) at my bank, Barklays Bank, Benet Street Cambridge &amp; arranged for two people beside myself to be entitled to take them out of the bank. These two people are J.M. Keynes, the economist, &amp; Piero Sraffa, a Fellow of my College of whom you might have heard. I have now decided to entitle you too to take out the stuff if anyone of my family should require it. My reason is this: I am not young, a foreigner, &amp; therefore perhaps in some (though not great) danger, Keynes is old &amp; ill, &amp; Sraffa who is the ideal man for my purpose is an Italian &amp; may be interned any day if Italy should enter the war. You are youngish &amp;, <hi rend="underline">comparatively</hi>, safe. I have given my bank your name &amp; they now need a specimen of your signature, by which they'll be able to identify you. So please send <hi rend="underline">me</hi> a slip of paper with your ordinary signature on it. ‒ I am in good bodily health but, as many people, find this time trying. Particularly the silly attitude (as it <hi rend="underline">seems</hi> to me) of people I see. ‒ I hope you will not lose all contact with your friends. They may not be much use to you now &amp; you may not be able to help them materially &amp; yet there's a <hi rend="underline">great</hi> point in not losing contact with them. If you should think that I'm a fool you might easily make a mistake. I wish you a lot of <hi rend="underline">life</hi>.</p> <p rend="indent">So long!</p> <p rend="indent">Yours affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
