Thanks a lot! They're the real thing! As you see I'm in Wales. I got here a few days ago &amp; should like to stay all through September. I enjoy the climate &amp; <hi rend="underline">not</hi> being in Cambridge.</p> <p rend="indent">Rhees, whom I think you remember, is here &amp; I see a good deal of him. ‒ We've had two VJ days &amp; I think there was much more noise than real joy. ‒ I've been working a good deal this last academic year, I mean for myself &amp; <hi rend="underline">if</hi> everything goes well I might publish by Christmas. Not that what I've produced is good, but it is now about as good as I can make it. I think when it'll be finished I ought to come into the open with it. (By the way, this isn't gossip.) ‒ I hope you're quite safe by now &amp; that you'll be plain M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, or D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, soon. Also hope to see you before long &amp; to tell you all I think of you. Rhees sends his best wishes. And so do I. Look after yourself, externally &amp; internally. So long!</p> <p rend="indent">Thanks again!</p> <p rend="indent">Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
