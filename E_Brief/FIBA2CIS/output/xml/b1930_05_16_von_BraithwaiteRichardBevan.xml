With the consent of the General Board of Faculties of the University, it has fixed your stipend for this year at £ 250, it being understood that you will give during each of the three terms of the academical year 1930/31 three hours instruction weekly on the same sat of lines (e.g. one hour lecture &amp; two hours conversation class) that you are giving this year.</p> <p rend="indent">In the memorandum which we sent to the General Board on the subject, reference was made to the very great success your lectures &amp; conversation classes this year are, &amp; to the fact that your pupils get a great deal from you that they could not get in any other way.</p> <p rend="indent">You will understand that this arrangement as at present made holds only for the next academic year. Neither the state of our finances nor the number of philosophical students can be prophesied further ahead.</p> <p rend="indent">This Board also agreed, &amp; the General Board has consented to pay you an extra £ 25 for your work this year, making the total payment to you this year £ 100 instead of £ 45. This is because you are giving three hours instruction weekly, &amp; when we suggested £ 45 we thought that you would only be giving two hours weekly. So I enclose a cheque for £ 62.10,0 (= £ 37.10.0 + £ 25) and a form of receipt, which please sign &amp; return to me.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours sincerely</p> <p rend="right">R B Braithwaite</p> <p rend="right">Secretary of the Board</p> <p rend="indent">I am sorry I have been (&amp; am still) ill, &amp; so have missed your discussion of generality.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
