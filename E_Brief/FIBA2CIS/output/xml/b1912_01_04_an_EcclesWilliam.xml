I have thought about your question &amp; hope you will be able to read the answer: I think you ought to go to some <hi rend="underline">first class</hi> German works before you go in for a job in England, <hi rend="underline">how ever</hi> good &amp; independent it may be. If however you can not get into <hi rend="underline">first class</hi> German works there seams to me to be no point in going to Germany at all. My reason is that you have got a very good memory for Engineering matters &amp; that I am sure you will be able to make use of <hi rend="underline">any amount</hi> of experience if once you are allowed to do as you like. This is not all together a common place because most people (e.g. myself) can only make real use of a small amount of experience in their work because their experience is not so alive in them. I do not know if you understand what I mean &amp; all that could much better be talked over. I am coming to Manchester about the 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> &amp; hope sincerely to meet you there. My studies are going on very satisfactorily &amp; I have lots to tell you about them.</p> <p rend="right">L.W.</p> <p rend="indent">How is your bride?</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
