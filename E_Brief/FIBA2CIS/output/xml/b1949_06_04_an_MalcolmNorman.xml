When I arrived here 3 weeks ago I went to see my doctor &amp; he had my blood examined. They found that I had a severe anaemia of a rather unusual kind. It was suspected that I had a gro[w]th in my stomack but the X-ray definitely showed that there is no such think inside me. I'm being given a lot of iron &amp; liverextract &amp; am getting better slowly. I think I shall certainly be able to sail with the Queen Mary on July 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. There is, however, the question how far my anaemia will affect my ability to discuss. At present I am quite unable to do any philosophy &amp; I don't think I'd be strong enough to have even a moderately decent discussion. In fact at present I'm <hi rend="underline">sure</hi> I couldn't do it. But of course it's possible that by the end of July I may have recovered sufficiently for my brain to work again. I intend to go to Cambridge in about 2 weeks &amp; to dictate some stuff if I feel strong enough. That will show me where I stand &amp; I'll let you know the result. Also I shall probably have a new blood examination done by them &amp; that'll also show something, in particular the rate at which I'm progressing. I <hi rend="underline">know</hi> that you'd extend your hospitality to me even if I were <hi rend="underline">completely</hi> dull &amp; stupid, but <hi rend="underline">I</hi> wouldn't want to be a mere dead weight in your house. I want to feel that I can at least give <hi rend="doubleunderline">a little</hi> for so much kindness. ‒ Anyhow, I hope that by July 21st I'll be a good deal more lively than now. (D.v.) ‒ The American Consul here has been pretty decent so far, but it turns out that I shall have to get the visa from the London Consul because I haven't resided in Ireland long enough. I hope that part of the matter will go moderately smoothely. ‒ I know that Miss Anscombe &amp; Smythies have not forgotten you, but I understand that it's difficult for them to write. I hardly ever hear from them, either. ‒ I <hi rend="underline">very much</hi> look forward to seeing you! Give my love to Lee &amp; Ray.</p> <p rend="indent">Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> <p rend="indent">P.S. I'm getting a ticket from New York to Ithaca here, so it isn't necessary that one of you should come &amp; fetch me, but if it could be done without difficulty I'd be very glad if you, or Lee did come to meet me at New York as I'm such a complete stranger &amp; exceedingly clumsy these days.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
