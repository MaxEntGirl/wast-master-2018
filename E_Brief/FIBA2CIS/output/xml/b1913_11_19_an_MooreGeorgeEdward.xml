I am very sorry that you feel so miserable at times about your work. I think, the cause of it is, that you don't regularly discuss your stuff with anybody who is not yet stale &amp; is <hi rend="underline">really</hi> interested in the subject. And I believe that at present there is no such person up at Cambridge. Even Russell ‒ who is of course most extraordinarily fresh for his age ‒ is no more pliable enough for <hi rend="underline">this</hi> purpose. Don't you think it would be a good thing if we had regular discussions when you come to me at Easter? Not ‒ of course ‒ that I am any good at the subject! But I am not yet stale &amp; care for it very much. I cann't help thinking that this would make you loose your feeling of sterility. I think you ought to think about your problems with the view to discuss them with me at Easter. Now don't you think that I am arrogant in saying this! I don't for a moment believe that I could get as clear about your questions as you can, but ‒ as I saied before ‒ I am not yet waisted &amp; am very interested in the stuff. <hi rend="underline">Do</hi> think this over. ‒ Let me hear from you soon.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours</p> <p rend="indent">most etc</p> <p rend="right">L. Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
