Wright,</p> <p rend="indent">Thanks for two letters. I haven't written for such a long time because there isn't anything to write about me. My trip to Norway hasn't come off. Richards failed his exam &amp; decided to take it again in September; so he has to cram &amp; can't have any holidays until the beginning of October. We plan to go to Norway then. I did some work, though not good work, for quite a time, but I've hardly done anything for the last 3 weeks, &amp; anyhow my ability for philosophical work seems to have practically vanished. ‒ I was very sorry to hear about your accident. I hope you'll get better soon. ‒ What you write about Spengler agrees with what I think of him. I looked at Toynbee the other day &amp; found him <hi rend="underline">very</hi> stupid. But perhaps he's amusing. ‒ Give my kind regards to your wife &amp; to her mother.</p> <p rend="indent">Good wishes!</p> <p rend="indent">Yours</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
