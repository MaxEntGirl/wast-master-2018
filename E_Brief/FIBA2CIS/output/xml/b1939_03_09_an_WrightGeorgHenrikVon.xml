I shall try to explain why the presence of two new people in my class, the other day, greatly disturbed me. â€’ I am, in my classes, doing my utmost to explain a <hi rend="underline">very</hi> difficult matter to the students who have been attending my classes this term. I know that it is quite impossible for any one coming in in the middle, or at <hi rend="underline">the end</hi>, of the term to get an idea of what we really are driving at. In fact he must necessarily get wrong ideas. I hope you will understand this, &amp; if you do you will also understand why being aware of this fact disturbs me a lot when I should be concentrating entirely on my subject. If I could, as many other people can, prepare my lectures in writing &amp; then read them off in front of the class the presence of new people would not disturb me. But as I'm unable to do this &amp; have to think things out afresh while I'm talking I am very easily disturbed.</p> <p rend="indent">In answer to your letter I suggest, therefore, that if you wish to come to my classes you should begin at the beginning of next term; but please don't come to the last few lectures (2 or 3) in this term. I hope you will see my point &amp; not think me unfriendly in suggesting this.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours sincerely</p> <p rend="right">L. Wittgenstein</p> <p rend="indent">P.S. If you like, come round to my rooms (at the above address) at 4.30 p.m. tomorrow. It may be easier for me to explain the matter to you when I see you than by writing. If you can't come don't bother to reply. I shan't wait for you longer than until 4.45 p.m.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
