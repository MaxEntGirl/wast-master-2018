I'm glad you had a good Christmas. Thank you for sending the book to Rhees. I'm sorry you had no time to read it. It's very remarkable. â€’ Things are going very well with me. I'm much stronger &amp; my nerves are all right. I have very good nights without using much of my sedatives. Please let Dr Bevan know about me &amp; give him my thanks for his last (very kind) note. I am completely acclimatized &amp; don't feel the cold as I did at first when I arrived.</p> <p rend="indent">I haven't been to a concert so far but I hear a fair amount of music. A friend of mine often plays the piano to me (very beautifully) &amp; one of my sisters &amp; he play piano duets. The other day they played two string quartets by Schumann &amp; a sonata written for 4 hands by Mozart.</p> <p rend="indent">The last two weeks I read a great deal in Goethe's "Farbenlehre". It's partly boring &amp; repelling, but in some ways also <hi rend="underline">very</hi> instructive &amp; philosophically interesting. You might take it out of your book case &amp; look at what he wrote about Lord Bacon in the <hi rend="underline">historical</hi> part.</p> <p rend="indent">Give my good wishes to everybody, particularly to your wife.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
