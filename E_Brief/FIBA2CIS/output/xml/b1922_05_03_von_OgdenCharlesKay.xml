[I should add that it was not proposed to print your <hi rend="underline">Preface</hi> in German as well as English, but only the numbered text and supplements, involving ambiguities.]</p> <p rend="indent">There are two further questions as regards printing</p> <p rend="indent">(1) in English the quotation marks are "‒" and in German „‒“ We can keep the German method for the German text.</p> <p rend="indent">(2) In your German text you always have italics indicated by "gesperrt" letters. We could use <hi rend="underline">italics</hi> instead, I suppose?</p> <p rend="indent">We have now been carefully through every one of your points and been able to make use of them all in some way.</p> <p rend="indent">I might mention that the corrections in ink were not by Russell but by the translator, so I hope you did not anywhere respect them too much.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours sincerely,</p> <p rend="right">C. K. Ogden</p> <p rend="indent">P.S. I have had all sentences where there is still a verbal difference required or suggested after reading your notes. Perhaps you can pass them all as satisfactory; but I am telling the printers to wait until I receive them back from you. So I hope you can check them &amp; return them registered very soon.</p> <p rend="indent">There is a special point as regards the formula 4.27 &amp; 4.42 which F. P. Ramsey (the Trinity mathematical prodigy) thinks I ought to bring to your notice for confirmation. Pinned on to this</p> <p rend="indent">Later I have just seen the printers, &amp; they will do both the quotations and the gesperrt letters just as in German.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
