But the case is important &amp; I know of nobody who could advise me about it but you. – Miss Alice Ambrose, my pupil, has got to write a thesis in order to get a job at Harvard next Autumn. For this purpose the thesis must be ready by next <hi rend="underline">October</hi>. Now it would help her a good deal if she could get a Cambridge Ph.D., but for this purpose the thesis ought to be ready by next April. – Now, although it is possible that she might by <hi rend="underline">April</hi> get something together which will do for a Ph.D., I’m certain that she can’t by then produce a really <hi rend="underline">good</hi> thesis. And, what is more important, her working feverishly (as she would have to work) at this thesis will prevent her from learning in the rest of this academic year what she ought to learn, &amp; is really here to learn.</p> <p rend="indent">Now, I suppose, there would be no serious trouble if it were not for the oral examination. For she could send in her thesis whenever she had it ready, say in Autumn, &amp; would then get her Ph.D. at some later date. But she has neither money nor time to come back here from America for an oral examination. She is, of course, in rather a desperate state about all this. For she herself feels that if she has to do the thesis for April it couldn’t be done really well as it ought, &amp; that giving all her time to her thesis would take it away from her most important object, i.e. that of <hi rend="underline">learning</hi> whatever she could as long as she is in Cambridge.</p> <p rend="indent">I wonder if anything could be done to help her. Possibly you could be so kind to tell me, when we see each other on Thursday, what I could do.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours </p> <p rend="indent">Ludwig Wittgenstein </p> </div> </div></body></text></TEI>
