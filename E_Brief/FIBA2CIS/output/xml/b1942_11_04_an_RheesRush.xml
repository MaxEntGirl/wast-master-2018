The first two were pretty rotten, especially the first: The third &amp; fourth (that's as far as I've got) went fairly well. I'm talking about the foundations of math.. Thouless is coming &amp; that's a good thing. Apart from him there is, maybe, <hi rend="underline">one</hi> whom I like to lecture to. There are about 10 altogether. My work here is unchanged. Roy, my mate, is still here &amp; I'm getting on well with him, &amp; as long as he'll be here I think I'll stick it. ‒ My lectures will probably go on moderately well as long as I am able ‒ as now ‒ to do a little work on the subject. I'm quite certain this won't be for very long.</p> <p rend="indent">I'm afraid I've no more time now to read any Latin, ‒ not that that worries me.</p> <p rend="indent">I had a letter from Drury recently from Egypt. He seems to be well &amp; interested in his work. ‒ Give my best wishes to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Rhees. I hope to hear from you before long.</p> <p rend="indent">Good wishes!</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
