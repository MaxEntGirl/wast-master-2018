It's as hot as hell here but the heat, though disagreable, is doing me good. I'm staying with a former pupil of mine who is a professor at the University here. He &amp; his wife are <hi rend="underline">very</hi> nice &amp; <hi rend="underline">very</hi> kind to me. ‒ How are you? Have you found a new job. I often think of you, particularly because I often thought I might take up my old work at Guys or some such place, &amp; now I'm such an old cripple that I couldn't possibly do the work I used to in the despensary lab. ‒ I'm doing my old work here, but at present not at all well because it's too damn hot. I've never had such heat in all my life. ‒ I intend to stay here about 3 months &amp; then I'll probably come to London for some days &amp; I hope to see you then. ‒ This place is about 8-9 hours by train west of New York, though it's in N.Y. <hi rend="underline">state</hi>.</p> <p rend="indent">I shan't write any more today because I feel <hi rend="underline">too</hi> stupid.</p> <p rend="indent">So long!</p> <p rend="indent">As always ‒</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
