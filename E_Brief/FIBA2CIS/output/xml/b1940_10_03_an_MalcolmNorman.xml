I was glad to hea[r] from you. It'll be fine to get detective mags from [you]. There is a terrible scarcity [of] them now. My mind feels [all] underfed. ‒ As a matter of fact I've been feeling pretty rotten most of this summer. Partly because of bad health, partly because my brain was no d... good at all &amp; I cou[l]dn't work. I'm feeling a bi[t] better now: that's to say, my hea[lth] is <hi rend="underline">entirely</hi> all right &amp; my mind seems a little more active. But God knows how long that'll last. I wish you good luck; in particular with your work at the university. The temptat[ion] for you to cheat yourself will be <hi rend="doubleunderline">overwhelming</hi> (tho[ugh] I don't mean more for you than for anyone else in your position.). <hi rend="underline">Only by a miracle</hi> will you be able to do decent work in teaching philosophy. Please remember these words, even if you forget everything I've ever said to you; &amp;, [if] you can help it, don't think [t]hat I'm a crank because nobody else will say this to you. ‒ I haven't heard from Smythies for about 4 months. I don't know why he doesn't write nor where he is, or anything. I see very few people these [d]ays. Skinner is almost the [o]nly person I see regularly. He has to work long hours but he's in good health. I don't see Wisdom at all. I've heard from a friend of mine in Montreal about Mrs. Wisdom. I think she's all right. ‒ Good luck!</p> <p rend="indent">Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
