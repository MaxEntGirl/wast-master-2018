Now the feeling that I shall have to dy before beeing able to publish them is growing stronger &amp; stronger in me every day &amp; my greatest wish would therefor be to communicate <hi rend="underline">everything</hi> I have done so far to you, <hi rend="underline">as soon as possible</hi>. Don't think that I believe that my ideas are very important but I cannot help feeling that they might help people to avoid <hi rend="underline">some</hi> errors. Or am I mistaken? if so don't take <hi rend="underline">any notice</hi> of this letter. I have of course no judgement at all as to whether my ideas are worth preserving after my death or not. And perhaps it is ridiculous of me even to consider this question at all. But if this is ridiculuos please try to excuse this foolishness of myne because it is not a superficial foolishness but the deepest of which I am capable. I see that the further I get on with this letter the less I dear to come to my Point. But my point is this: I want to ask you to let me meet you <hi rend="underline">as soon as possible</hi> &amp; give me time enough to give you a survey of the whole field of what I have done up to now &amp; if possible to let me make notes for you <hi rend="underline">in your presence</hi>. I shall arrive in London on the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> of Oct. &amp; shall have to be in London again on Oct 3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> (evening). Otherwise I am not fixed in any way &amp; can meet you wherever you like. My address will be the Grand Hotel. ‒ I know that it may be both arrogant &amp; silly to ask you what I have asked you. But such I am &amp; think of me what you like. I will <hi rend="underline">allways</hi> be yours</p> <p rend="right">L. W.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
