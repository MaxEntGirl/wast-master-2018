I'm sorry you couldn't manage to see me. I feel pretty rotten in many ways, though less so now that I've moved into College. I have a very quiet room &amp; a very nice bedmaker &amp; that's a lot. I haven't been able to do decent work in my subject for a whole year; to be exact, since the crisis last year. This, I think, is due, partly at any rate, to the nauseating effect political events here &amp; elsewhere have had on me, but it may also be due to age or what not. I seem to be washed up, as a researcher for good; &amp; this is a serious business for me because I feel I'm no longer really qualified to hold my present past &amp; because I'm oldish &amp; don't know what else to do. Perhaps the war (<hi rend="underline">if</hi> it should ever become a real war) may solve this problem for me. I should <hi rend="tripleunderline">very</hi> much like to see you, as you know. So if you can bring this about, don't hesitate.</p> <p rend="indent">So long!</p> <p rend="indent">Yours affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
