But the truth is, I'm glad I have changed my mind. It was an awful thought to go &amp; sit there among logical positivists &amp; the like; even your presence couldn't make up for all the nastiness. I couldn't however make up my mind not to go until this morning I had an idea which I can't very easily explain to you in writing. The gist of it is that I am thinking of publishing something before long after all so as to end the constant misunderstandings &amp; misinterpretations. I very much want to talk the business over with you. Please forgive my fickleness or, at any rate, suspend your judgement until you've had another talk with me.</p> <p rend="indent">I hope very much to see you before long.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
