Wright,</p> <p rend="indent">Thank you so much for your letter, dated Aug. 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. I was <hi rend="underline">very</hi> glad to get it. I wish I were in that landscape of yours. It must be similar to the landscape in Norway, which I love. I wish you were here &amp; could help me with my discussion classes. They should start in about 3 weeks; but I can't imagine how I shall be able to lecture. I feel as though, under the present shameful &amp; depressing circumstances, I ought to do anything but discuss philosophical problems, with people who aren't really deeply interested in them anyway.</p> <p rend="indent">I should very much like to send you the M.S. of what would be the first volume of my book. I have an idea that it shall never be published in my lifetime &amp; might perhaps be entirely lost. I should like to know that you had read it &amp; had a copy of it. Write me if you like to have it; &amp; if it can be sent I'll send it to you.</p> <p rend="indent">I think it goes without saying that I shall always be exceedingly glad to hear from you. I myself am a <hi rend="underline">bad</hi> correspondent, especially now that everything that I do seems to me futile &amp; I don't know what sort of life I ought to lead.</p> <p rend="indent">Let me hear from you before long.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
