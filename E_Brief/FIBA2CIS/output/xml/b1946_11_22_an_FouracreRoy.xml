I am <hi rend="underline">very</hi> sorry to hear this, both for you &amp; for those who are looking forward to seeing you again. Though why in bl... anyone should wish to see you back here beats me. ‒ You say you haven't heard from me again for some time, but I'm writing pretty regularly. It's the Censor who keeps my letters; &amp; I don't blame him either, because they're so full of wit &amp; wisdom. It must be difficult for him to read one of them &amp; then let it go again. I'm sure he collects them &amp; one day they'll all be published. ‒ The weather here is awful &amp; I feel pretty lousy most of the time. My lectures are going well, so far. What I miss most is someone I can talk nonsense to by the yard. ‒ Let me know your new address soon, so I can write you a Christmas card.</p> <p rend="indent">Look after yourself &amp; be good. God bless you!</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> <p rend="indent"><hi rend="underline">Space for Notes.</hi></p> <p rend="right">P.T.O.</p> <p rend="indent"><hi rend="underline">Space for Notes.</hi></p> </div></body></text></TEI>
