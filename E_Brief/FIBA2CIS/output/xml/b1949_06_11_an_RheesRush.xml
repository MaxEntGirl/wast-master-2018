I'll have enough now for ages to come. You didn't enclose any sort of bill. Please let me know what I owe you. And don't say "Och!" ‒ I think I'm getting better, though <hi rend="underline">very</hi> slowly. I'll have an other blood test done next week &amp; I'm sure it'll show a change. If I were only physically week it wouldn't matter much, but the trouble is I can't <hi rend="underline">think</hi>. And I can't (or is it <hi rend="underline">don't</hi>) really make an effort. ‒ I intend to leave here on Saturday 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> &amp; fly to London for a few days, then to Cambridge for 10 or 12 days &amp; then to Uxbridge (Richards) until July 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> when I sail on the Queen Mary. Whether I'll be able to dictate at Cambridge &amp; whether I'll be able to stand the life at Uxbridge <hi rend="underline">I don't know</hi>. ‒ Swansea has the great disadvantage of being so very hilly. It's beautiful, but I can't climb hills these days. Perhaps, however, this will change soon. I wish I knew. ‒ I should very much like to know if M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Rhees could put me up for a few days in July <hi rend="underline">if</hi> it were necessary. Perhaps you could find out for me. I intend to go to Cambridge on the 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, or 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> June &amp; I'll stay with von Wright. His address is: "Strathaird"</p> <p rend="right">Lady Margarets Road</p> <p rend="right">Cambridge.<lb/> P.T.O.</p> <p/> <p rend="indent">I very much hope that somehow I'll be able to see you soon! i.e., before going to America, if I do go. ‒</p> <p rend="indent">So long! &amp; thanks again!</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> <p rend="indent">Drury sends his good wishes. I see a good deal of him these days.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
