You know, of course, more than I about the recent events in Austria. I take it, it is conceivable that they are the immediate preparation for a war &amp; if a war should brake out now, God knows what would happen &amp; I’m not talking about this possibility. Rather I assume that a war is not going to brake out within the next 6 months. Assuming this I want to know what I shall do. My plan originally was to go to Austria in May or June for one of my usual visits, to stay there a month or so &amp; to return to Cambridge or Dublin. As things are now I wonder a) whether I shall be let out of Austria if I go there, b) whether I shall be let in to England from Austria. Now both to be able to leave Austria &amp; to enter England are of vital importance to me. To have to live in Austria would be intollerable to me &amp; I have friends in England I don’t want to leave. Now I have still about 300-400 £ in England (I have no money in Austria) &amp; they would allow me to live a year at least without taking a job &amp; this on the whole is good for my work (i.e. my book). But I think now it may be important for me to try &amp; get a job as a lecturer of sorts at Cambridge (I don’t mean get a lectureship, as there’s none vacant, but let them pay me for a course of lectures as they used to.) My object is this:</p> <p rend="indent">1) if I can say that I’ve got a job in England they can’t so easily detain me in Austria </p> <p rend="indent">2) if I have a job at Cambridge they, I mean the English immigration people, will let me come back to England. </p> <p rend="indent">3) If I’m not jobless, I shall more easily find a job elsewhere &amp; perhaps acquire some other citizenship. For I am more anxious than ever of chucking my austrian citizenship.</p> <p rend="indent">I needn’t say that, being of jewish de[s]cent I <hi rend="underline">couldn’t</hi> get a job in Austria. (But even if I <hi rend="underline">had</hi> a chance I’ld rather do anything than take it)</p> <p rend="indent">I am for the reasons mentioned inclined to go back to Cambridge next term (or during the vac) give some discussions as I always do &amp; try [to] be taken on as <hi rend="underline">some</hi> sort of lecturer. I’ld <hi rend="underline">rather</hi> get a job over here in Ireland but I think there is no chance at present (but may be in future). By the way, when I said I may try to acquire an other citizenship I thought of the Irish one. I don’t know whether I can explain my reason, but roughly it is this that here I couldn’t be regarded as anything than a refugee pure &amp; simple whereas in England with a Brittish passport I would be a kind of sham-englishman. I don’t know if you see my point, &amp; <hi rend="underline">possibly</hi> I’m wrong anyway. – Now I should like to have your oppinion about my reasoning &amp; whether it is advisable &amp; right* to try for a job at Cambridge. I’m sorry to trouble you with this; but the fact was, I even thought of comming to England just to see you &amp; hear your oppinion. If you can, please write to me. I hope this letter still reaches you in Cambridge &amp; I hope to see you anyhow at or after Easter. The sooner the better.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours </p> <p rend="indent">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div> <div type="postscript" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"> <p rend="indent">* or whether there is something fishy about it </p> </div> </div></body></text></TEI>
