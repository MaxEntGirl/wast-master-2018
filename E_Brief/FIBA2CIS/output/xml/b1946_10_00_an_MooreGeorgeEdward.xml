Mrs Moore wrote to me, could I come next Tuesday, instead. Now I'm free on Tuesday afternoon &amp;, as you know, should like to see you, not for any particular reason, but in an ordinary friendly way. But I am sure you'll understand that, ‒ under the peculiar circumstances, ‒ I should like to know whether what Mrs Moore wrote to me was an honest to God invitation for me to come &amp; see you on Tuesday, or whether it was a kind of hint that I'ld better not try to see you. If it was the latter, please don't hesitate to say so. I will not be hurt <hi rend="underline">in the slightest</hi>, for I know that queer things happen in this world. It's one of the few things I've really learnt in my life. So please, if that's how it is, just write on a p.c. something like "Don't come". I enclose a card in case you haven't got one. I'll understand everything. Good luck &amp; good wishes!</p> <p rend="indent">Yours</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
