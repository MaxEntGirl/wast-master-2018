There are two things I want to ask you:</p> <p rend="indent">a) I thought the other day when we talked in your room you were not disinclined to give me some sort of introduction to Maiski the Embassador. I then said I thought he would not be the man who would give me the advice I wanted. But I've been told since that <hi rend="underline">if</hi> he were inclined to give me a letter of introduction to some officials in Russia it would help me a lot. Therefore my first question is, would you be willing to give me an introduction to Maiski so as to make it possible for me to have a conversation with him, as the result of which he <hi rend="underline">might</hi> give me an introduction?</p> <p rend="indent">b) I have now more or less decided to go to Russia as a Tourist in September &amp; see whether it is possible for me to get a suitable job there. If I find (which, I'm afraid is quite likely) that I can't find such a job, or get permission to work in Russia, then I should want to return to England &amp; if possible study Medicine. Now when you told me that you would finance me during my medical training you did not know, I think, that I wanted to go to Russia &amp; that I would try to get permission to practice medicine in Russia. I know that you are not in favour of my going there (&amp; I think I understand you). Therefore I must ask you whether, under these circumstances, you would still be prepared to help me. I don't like to ask you this question, not because I risk a 'No', but because I hate asking any questions about this matter. If you reply please just write on a P.C.:</p> <p rend="indent">a) No or a) Yes etc</p> <p rend="indent">b) No etc</p> <p>as the case may be.</p> <p rend="indent">I shall not think it in the least unkind of you if you answer both <hi rend="underline">a</hi> and <hi rend="underline">b</hi> negatively.</p> <p rend="indent">I left your room the other day with a sad feeling. It is only too natural that you shouldn't entirely understand what makes me do what I am doing, nor how hard it is for me.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours ever</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
