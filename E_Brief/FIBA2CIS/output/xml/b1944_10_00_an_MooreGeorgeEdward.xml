It seems to me that the most important point was the 'absurdity' of the assertion "There is a fire in this room &amp; I don't believe there is." To call this, as I think you did, 'an absurdity for <hi rend="underline">psychological</hi> reasons' seems to me to be wrong, or <hi rend="underline">highly</hi> misleading. (If I ask someone "Is there a fire in the next room?" &amp; he answers "I believe there is" I can't say: "Don't be irrelevant. I asked you about the fire, not about your state of mind!") But what I wanted to say was this. Pointing out that 'absurdity' which is in fact something <hi rend="underline">similar</hi> to a contradiction, though it isn't one, is so important that I <hi rend="underline">hope you'll publish</hi> your paper. By the way, don't be shocked at my saying it's something 'similar' to a contradiction. This means roughly: it plays a similar role in logic. You have said something about the <hi rend="underline">logic</hi> of assertion. Viz: It makes sense to say "Let's suppose: p is the case &amp; I don't believe that p is the case", whereas it makes <hi rend="underline">no</hi> sense to assert "|â€’ p is the case &amp; I don't believe that p is the case". This <hi rend="underline">assertion</hi> has to be ruled out &amp; <hi rend="underline">is</hi> ruled out by 'common sense', just as a contradiction is. And this just shows that logic isn't as simple as logicians think it is. In particular: that contradiction isn't the <hi rend="underline">unique</hi> thing people think it is It isn't the <hi rend="underline">only</hi> logically inadmissible form &amp; it is, under certain circumstances, admissible. And to show this seems to me the chief merit of your paper. In a word it seems to me that you've made a <hi rend="underline">discovery</hi>, &amp; that you should publish it.</p> <p rend="indent">I hope to see you privately some day.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours sincerely</p> <p rend="right">L. Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
