I can quite immagine that you don't admire Weininger very much, what with that beastly translation &amp; the fact that W. must feel very foreign to you. It is true that he is fantastic but he is <hi rend="underline">great</hi> &amp; fantastic. It isn't necessary or rather not possible to agree with him but the greatness lies in that with which we disagree. It is his enormous mistake which is great. I.e. roughly speaking if you just add a "~" to the whole book it says an important truth. However we better talk about it when I come back. ‒ I've had a very busy time since I left Cambridge &amp; have done a fair amount of work. Now I want you to do me a favour: I don't intend to give any formal lectures this term as I think I must reserve all my strength for my own work. I will however have <hi rend="underline">private</hi> (unpaid) discussions with students if there are any who want them. That's to say I don t want to be mentioned in the lecture list this term but at the same time Braithwaite could tell his Students (and you can tell yours) that if any of them wish to have conversations with me I will arrange times with them. Please write a line to Braithwaite to explain this before the beginning of September. ‒ During the first month of the vac we had terribly hot weather &amp; now it's abominably cold &amp; rainy. I'm sorry to hear that the weather in England depresses you, I'm not as fit as I ought to be either.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours ever</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
