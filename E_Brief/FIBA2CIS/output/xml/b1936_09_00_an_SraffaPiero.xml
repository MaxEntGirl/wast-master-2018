I am glad I have come here. Life here does me good though it's not easy (or rather for that reason). I live alone in a little house outside the village. You can't see it on this p.c.. I have to do all the house work myself &amp; it takes a good deal of time. But that's good too. My work goes fairly well. - When I came here I was ill &amp; couldn't recover for some time, but now I'm perfectly well. I think of you quite often &amp; not with disagreable feelings. I also sometimes think of our last conversation in the Backs about Spain &amp; how wrong I was. My address is: Skjolden i Sogn, in case you care to let me hear from you. I hope you are well &amp; that your work goes well. Give my love to Keynes and also to Watson. Tell the latter not to be too damn lazy &amp; to let me hear from him.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours </p> <p rend="indent">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div> <div type="postscript" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"> <p>My house lies on the lake which begins here, for <hi rend="doubleunderline">this</hi> is the fjord</p> </div> </div></body></text></TEI>
