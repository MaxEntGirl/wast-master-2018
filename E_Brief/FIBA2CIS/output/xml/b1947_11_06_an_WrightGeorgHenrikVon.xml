CAMB.</p> <p rend="right">6.11.47.</p> <p>Dear v. Wright,</p> <p rend="indent">Thanks for your letter. I have resigned but my professorship ends on December 31<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. I shall stay here for another 3 weeks, I'm dictating some of the stuff which I wrote during the last 2-3 years. It's mostly bad but I've got to have it in a handy form, i. e. typewritten, because it may possibly give rise to better thoughts when I read it. I don't know where in Ireland I shall be but the address "Trinity College" will always find me. I am in <hi rend="underline">no</hi> way optimistic about my future but as soon as I had resigned I felt that it was the only natural thing to have done. ‒ In dictating my stuff I am using up the paper you were so <hi rend="underline">very</hi> nice to bequeathe to me. ‒ "Der Schmetterling" I don't like as much as "Eduards Traum", but it's wonderful in parts. Especially the homecoming. You are quite right, I found the book by an extraordinary chance in a shop in Vienna.</p> <p rend="indent">I hope to hear from you often if you're not too busy. I wish you luck!</p> <p rend="indent">Yours</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
