I am now in Swansea working at my book. Whether with success or not, God knows. ‒ I hadn't a good impression from your letter. Though it[']s very difficult for me to say what's wrong. I feel as though you were getting more &amp; more slovenly. I'm not <hi rend="underline">blaming</hi> you for it, &amp; I'ld have no right to do so. But I've been thinking what's to be done about it. Seeing a psychologist ‒ unless he is a very extraordinary <hi rend="doubleunderline">man</hi> ‒ wo[uldn't] get you far. <hi rend="underline">Also</hi> I'm not [clear ?] whether you [will ?] be [particularly ?] good in a lab or in an operating theater. You've got to be rather quick there &amp; resourceful, &amp; I just don't know if you are. One thing seems to me fairly clear: that you mustn't go on in a humiliating or demoralising position. I wish I could talk it over with you &amp; hear <hi rend="underline">your</hi> side of the question. I think, if they won't give you a commission, you should either try &amp; make a <hi rend="doubleunderline">good</hi> job of what you're doing, <hi rend="underline">whatever</hi> it is; or, if you find you just can't do that, apply to be sent, in whatever capacity, to a unit near the front where you'll at least live some sort of <hi rend="underline">life</hi>. I have extremely little courage myself, much less than [you]; but I have found that [how]ever, after [a] long [struggle], I screwed my courage up to do something I always felt <hi rend="underline">much</hi> freer &amp; happier after it. I know that you have a family; but you won't be any use to your family if you're no use to yourself &amp; in case Lotte doesn't see this now she'll see it one day. Write to me what you think about this &amp; if possible lets talk it over. I think you must stop creeping &amp; start <hi rend="underline">walking</hi> again. I don't write this because I don't care for you, but on the contrary. Of course I may be <hi rend="underline">all wrong</hi>. But this is how I see it at present. ‒ When I talked of courage by the way I didn't mean, make a row with your superior; particularly not when it's entirely useless &amp; just shooting off your mouth. I meant: take a burden &amp; try to <hi rend="underline">carry</hi> it. I know that I've not any right to say this. I'm not much good at carrying burdens myself. But still it's all I've got to say; until perhaps I can see you.</p> <p rend="indent">Love &amp; good wishes</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
