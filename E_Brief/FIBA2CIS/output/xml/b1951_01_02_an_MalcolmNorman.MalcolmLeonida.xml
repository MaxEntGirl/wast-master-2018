I have the pull-over on right now &amp; am looking very distinguished in it. â€’ I don't know if I wrote to you that when I was in Norway in October I thought of going back there to do some work. I asked a friend there who has a farm could I come back &amp; stay over the winter, or longer. I was told that I could. It would have been a <hi rend="underline">very</hi> cheap &amp; very quiet place. I booked a passage on a steamer Newcastle-Bergen on Dec. 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. Shortly before Christmas I heard that my friend could not put me up after all &amp; at the same time I fell ill &amp; so couldn't have gone anyway. I'm very much better now &amp; I'm waiting for some news from some other people in Norway to whom I wrote, asking them if they knew a suitable place for me. So far I haven't heard from them &amp; I'm <hi rend="underline">not</hi> optimistic. I spent Christmas in Cambridge in my doctors house. I'd gone to see him to have an examination before travelling to Norway &amp; I fell ill in his house &amp; had to stay there. Yesterday I came back here &amp; found your lovely present &amp; Xmas card. In Cambridge I read a book which interested me &amp; which I thought was rather well written. It's called "Rommel" by an English Brigadier Young &amp; is a kind of biography of the German general &amp; a history of his exploits. I thought it might be a possible, though very belated, Christmas present &amp; I'm sending it to you. It's possible that you won't like it at all.</p> <p rend="indent">All good wishes, as always, &amp; thanks again.</p> <p rend="indent">Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
