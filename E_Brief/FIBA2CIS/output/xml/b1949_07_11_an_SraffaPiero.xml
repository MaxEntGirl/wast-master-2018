Wright was in the room with me, when I phoned. I said to him that you had given me rather a queer answer (explaining to him the reason for my call). He said: No wonder, as you said to him you hadn’t written because what had happened didn’t mean anything to you. Von Wright had understood me to say to you: "I did not write because what happened didn’t mean anything to me" – whereas I had said over the phone (<hi rend="underline">very clumsily</hi>) "I did not not write because what happened didn’t mean anything to me" meaning of course that my not writing was not to be taken to mean that what had happened didn’t mean anything to me. – I write all this because I don’t want to give offence by a clumsy expression which was not understood over the phone. <hi rend="underline">If</hi>, that is, you really misheard what I said.</p> <p rend="indent">I want to add that I started writing to you in answer to your letter as soon as I got it but tore up what I’d written because I found that I couldn’t say anything but common places &amp; that you knew exactly how I felt. I don’t mean that someone else could not have done better, &amp; even <hi rend="underline">I</hi> could have done so perhaps, under different circumstances, e.g. if our languages (yours &amp; mine) were more similar, if we had seen more of each other &amp; if I hadn’t myself been ill &amp; depressed at the time it happened. – When I phoned today the reason was that I felt I might say something to you <hi rend="underline">now</hi> if we arranged to meet. It didn’t come off.</p> <p rend="indent"><hi rend="underline">If</hi> this letter is quite superfluous I shall not regret having written it.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours </p> <p rend="indent">L. Wittgenstein </p> </div> </div></body></text></TEI>
