Here is another letter from Keynes I received just now. I want to make a few remarks about it.</p> <p rend="indent">a) His writing to the Home Office for forms before giving me an introduction to his solicitor is, I should say, nonsense. He seems in some way disinclined to give me this introduction.</p> <p rend="indent">b) What he writes about a grant of 25 £ from the Academic Assistance Council won't do either. I wrote to him 2 days ago that I had told Prof. Moore that I had <hi rend="underline">plenty</hi> of money &amp; that all that mattered was that the University should invite me to lecture &amp; possibly give me some <hi rend="underline">tiny</hi> salary, say <hi rend="underline">5</hi> £ a term (or less) because I don't need the money, except in order to be able to say that I'm having a salaried job. ‒ The 'Academic Assistance Council' is a body who helpes people, say refugees, who have no money, &amp; accepting these assistance would not only not be fair of me but also place me in an <hi rend="underline">entirely</hi> wrong category.</p> <p rend="indent">c) There is something to be said for waiting with my application for naturalisation until I had got a job at Cambridge; &amp; it is this that the University will have to apply to the Home Office for a permission for me to take a job in this country. Now if my application for naturalisation reaches the Home Office <hi rend="underline">after</hi> the University's application the Home Office will already know me in a sense &amp; know that people at Cambridge want to have me there; &amp; this may help me. The cutting which Keynes sends me <hi rend="underline">seems</hi> to give me more time than I thought I had if what the paper writes is reliable.</p> <p rend="indent">Now what I want you to do is, as it were, to <hi rend="doubleunderline">smell</hi> to this letter of Keynes' &amp; tell me whether I should wait for his sending me an introduction to his solicitor, or write to him thanking him for taking all this trouble &amp; saying that I would now proceed on my own.</p> <p rend="indent">My reason for thinking that it <hi rend="underline">might</hi> be wiser not to wait for an introduction from Keynes to his solicitor is that I have a <hi rend="underline">vague fear</hi> that this introduction, if slightly wrongly worded, might make things in a way more awkward for me; it may, for instance, represent me as a <hi rend="underline">refugee</hi> of sorts &amp; stress a wrong aspect of the business. <hi rend="underline">Perhaps this is all bosh</hi>, but I must say that I have a suspicion that Keynes may give it that turn not out of malice, of course.</p> <p rend="indent">Now could you do the following: In case this letter reaches you today in good time, read it, smell to Keynes' letter, &amp; <hi rend="underline">if</hi> you think I ought not to wait send me a telegram "come to London" (or something of the sort) &amp; I shall then come on Monday morning or possibly tomorrow, if you care to go to a cinema with me. Please dont destroy Keynes' letter &amp; keep mine too.</p> <p rend="indent">In the present damp weather I think it is good to rap up my letters in a silver watertight cover.</p> <p rend="indent"><hi rend="underline">So long!</hi></p> <p rend="indent">With blood</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> <p rend="indent">If you think there's no hurry wire nothing or the words "no hurry"</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
