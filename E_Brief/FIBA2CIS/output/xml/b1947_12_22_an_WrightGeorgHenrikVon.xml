Wright,</p> <p rend="indent">Thank you for your X-mas letter. A day or two ago I sent you a card. As you see form the above address I'm not solitary. This is a big sort of farm &amp; they take guests in summer but not during the winter, &amp; so I'm alone with the family. They are very quiet, I have my meals in my room &amp; am very little disturbed. Still, I could do with greater loneliness &amp; I intend to exchange this place for a more lonely one later in the year. Red Cross is a village but the farm is about 2 miles outside it &amp; fairly isolated. I am working a fair amount. Not too bad ‒ &amp; not too good. Heaven knows if I'll ever publish this work, but I should like you to look at it after my death if you survive me. There is a good deal of hard thinking in it. I feel <hi rend="underline">a good deal</hi> better here than in Cambridge.</p> <p rend="indent">What you write about not intending to apply for the professorship in Cambridge I understand perfectly, &amp; I had assumed before you wrote to me that you'd not apply. The chief reason why <hi rend="underline">I</hi> thought it was, that the prospect of becoming English, or a refugee in England, seemed to me anything but attractive in our time, &amp; I thought that you would <hi rend="underline">certainly</hi> not wish to bring up your children in England. I hope for your sake you won't be compelled to do so; though for Cambridge it would be lucky, unless Cambridge were to drag you down, which, however, I don't assume.</p> <p rend="indent">'Der Schmetterling' is, in part, marvelous e. g. the end when he comes home ‒ "<hi rend="underline">Es war ein lustiges Schneegestöber</hi><hi rend="underline"> bei nördlichem Winde ...".</hi></p> <p rend="indent">I read hardly anything: a few detective stories &amp; some other things I've already read many times. Real reading is always bad for me.</p> <p rend="indent">I have a close friend in Dublin (about 2½ - 3 hours journey from here) whom I can see about once a month. Whether I'll go to Norway again I don't know at all. ‒ Thanks for the cutting. I think I know where the Steinlavine must have gone down. I hope nothing has happened to any of the people I know!</p> <p rend="indent">I wish you good thoughts &amp; good feelings &amp; that nothing shall make you shallow. I hope somehow to see you again some day before so very long.</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> <p rend="indent">P.S. On looking at your address I see that I made a mistake on the envelope of my X-mas card I wrote 77 instead of 7. I wonder if you'll get it.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
