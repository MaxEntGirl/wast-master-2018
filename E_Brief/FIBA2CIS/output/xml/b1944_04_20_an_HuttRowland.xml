Do that work decently which you're doing <hi rend="doubleunderline">now</hi>. Don't always look into the future. They may not put you into the op. theater, &amp; if they do you <hi rend="underline">may</hi> not be a success. It seems to me that you're alternately living in unfounded hopes &amp; in despair. Look at the work you're <hi rend="doubleunderline">doing</hi>. <hi rend="underline">If</hi> you're really doing it well they <hi rend="underline">may</hi> give you a chance elsewhere. To pester your Commander about a commission now seems to me silly. <hi rend="underline">Nothing</hi> has changed since you've been refused! You write: "All these steps have made or will make my position here satisfactory, or at least a lot better." This is all nonsense; &amp; it makes me really sick to read it. The one step which can make things more satisfactory for you is a step that has to be taken inside you. (Though I won't say that getting away from your family mightn't help.)</p> <p rend="indent"><hi rend="underline">Good wishes, as always</hi>!</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
