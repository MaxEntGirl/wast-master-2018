Last Sunday I, too, fell ill with a mild gastric flue &amp; I've heard since that there are lots of other cases about. I'm out of bed today, at least <hi rend="underline">so far</hi>. I still worked on Sunday but not after that, &amp; I may not be able to work for quite a time. ‒ Last Friday I had my talk with Drury's boss. I made things <hi rend="underline">very</hi> clear, &amp; he seemed to listen &amp; took it in a kind spirit, but I very much doubt if it's done any good. I don't like the look of things at all. ‒ I hope you are better. I know that flu has a long aftermath. Good wishes!</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
