Wright wrote to me about his putting in for the professorship &amp; asked me to write him a recommendation. I did, &amp; it won't be the recommendation's fault if he doesn't get the job. I don't know <hi rend="underline">at all</hi> what his chances are. I'm <hi rend="underline">slightly</hi> doubtful because of his being another foreigner. ‒ My work is progressing <hi rend="underline">very</hi> slowly &amp; painfully, but it is progressing. I wish I had more working power &amp; didn't tire so <hi rend="underline">very</hi> easily. But I have to take it as I find it. ‒ Your mags are wonderful. How people can read Mind if they could read Street &amp; Smith beats me. If philosophy has anything to do with wisdom there's certainly not a grain of that in Mind, &amp; quite often a grain in the detective stories.</p> <p rend="indent">That'll be all for today because my brain feels very stuffy indeed.</p> <p rend="indent"><hi rend="underline">Good wishes!</hi></p> <p rend="indent">Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
