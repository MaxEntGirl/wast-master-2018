Now listen: I will first talk about those Logical props which are or might be contained in the first 8 Chapters of Princ. Math. That they all follow from <hi rend="underline">one</hi> Pp is clear because <hi rend="doubleunderline">one</hi> <hi rend="underline">symbolic rule</hi> is sufficient to recognize each of them as true or false. And this is the <hi rend="underline">one</hi> symbolic rule: Write the prop down in the ab-Notation, trace all Connections (of Poles) from the outside to the inside Poles: Then if the b-Pole is connected to such <hi rend="underline">Groups of inside Poles <hi rend="doubleunderline">only</hi> as contain oposite poles of <hi rend="doubleunderline">one</hi> prop</hi>, then the whole prop is a true, logical prop. If on the other hand this is the case with the a-Pole the prop is false &amp; logical. If finaly neither is the case the prop may be true or false but is in no case Logical. Such for instance (p).~p p limited to a suitable type of course is not a logical prop at all &amp; its truth can neither be proved nor disproved from logical pro[p]s allon. The Same is the case ‒ by the way ‒ with your axiom of reducibility, <hi rend="underline">it is not a logical Prop at all</hi> &amp; the same applies to the axioms of infinity &amp; the mult. ax. <hi rend="doubleunderline">If</hi> these are true props they are what I shall call "accidentally" true &amp; and not "essentially" true. Whether a prop is accidentally or essentially true can be seen by writing it down in the ab-Notation &amp; applying the above rule. What I ‒ in stating this rule ‒ called "logical" prop is a prop which is either essentially true or essentially false. This distinction of accid. &amp; essent. true props explains ‒ by the way ‒ the feeling one allways had about the infin. ax. &amp; the axiom of reducibility, the feeling that if they where true they would be so only by a lucky accident.</p> <p rend="indent">Of course the rule I have given applies first of all only for what you called elementary props. But it is easy to see that it must also apply to all others: For consider your two Pps in the Theory of app. vars <hi rend="superscript">*</hi>9.1 &amp; <hi rend="superscript">*</hi>9.11. Put there instead of <formula corresp="images/formulas/b1913_11_30_an_RussellBertrand_01.gif"/> and it becomes obvious that the special cases of these two Pps like those of all the previous ones become tautologous if you apply the ab-Notation. The ab-Notation for Identity is not yet clear enough to show this clearly but it is obvious that such a Notation can be made up. I can sum up by saying that a logical prop is one the speciale cases of which are either tautologous ‒ &amp; then the prop is true ‒ or "selfcontradictory" (as I shall call it) &amp; then it is false. And the ab Notation simply showes directly which of those two it is (if any). That means there is <hi rend="underline">one</hi> Method of proving or disprooving all logical props and this is: writing them down in the ab-Notation &amp; looking at the connections &amp; apply the above rule. But if <hi rend="underline">one</hi> symbolic rule will do, there must also be <hi rend="underline">one</hi> P.p. that will do.</p> <p rend="indent">There is much that follows from all this &amp; much that I could only explain vaguely but if you realy think it over you will find that I am right. ‒ I am glad that your classes are a success. As to Wiener I can only say that, if he is good at Math, Math isn't much good. However ‒</p> <p rend="indent">‒ Write again soon! And think allways well of your </p> <p rend="right">LW</p> <p rend="indent">P.S. Please remember me to Hardy. Every letter of yours gives me infinite pleasure!</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
