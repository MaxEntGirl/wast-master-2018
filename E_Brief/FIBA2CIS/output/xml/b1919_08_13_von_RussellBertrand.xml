W.</p> <p rend="right">13 August 1919.</p> <p>Dear Wittgenstein</p> <p rend="indent">I have now read your book twice carefully ‒ There are still points I don't understand ‒ some of them important ones ‒ I send you some queries on separate sheets. I am convinced you are right in your main contention, that logical props are tautologies, which are not true in the sense that substantial props are true. I do not understand why you are content with a purely ordinal theory of number, nor why you use for the purpose an ancestral relation, when you object to ancestral relations. This part of your work I want further explained. Also you do not state your reasons against classes. <hi rend="underline">I am sure you are right in thinking the book of first-class importance</hi>. But in places it is obscure through brevity. I have a most intense desire to see you, to talk it over, as well as simply because I want to see you. But I can't get abroad as yet. Probably you will be free to come to England before I am free to go abroad. ‒ I will send back your MS when I know where to send it, but I am hoping you will soon be at liberty.</p> <p rend="indent">All best wishes. Do write again soon‒</p> <p rend="indent">Yours ever</p> <p rend="right">B Russell.</p> <p><hi rend="underline">Wittgenstein</hi></p> <p>2. What is the difference between Tatsache and Sachverhalt?</p> <p>3. "Das logische Bild der Tatsachen ist der Gedanke." Yes, I agree. But a Gedanke is a Tatsache: what are its constituents &amp; components, &amp; what is their relation to those of the pictured Tatsache?</p> <p>3.331. The theory of types, in my view, is a theory of correct symbolism: (a) a simple symbol must not be used to express anything complex; (b) more generally, a symbol must have the same structure as its meaning.</p> <p>4 &amp; 4.001. "Der Gedanke ist der sinnvolle Satz." "Die Gesamtheit der Sätze ist die Sprache." Does a Gedanke consist of words? Compare 3 (above).</p> <p>4.112. I agree strongly with this number.</p> <p>4.1272 I suppose this hangs together with the rejection of identity. It is awkward to be unable to speak of Nc'∇. One could still say <hi rend="line-through">(∃φ,x).N</hi></p> <p>             <formula corresp="images/formulas/b1919_08_13_von_RussellBertrand_01.gif"/> </p> <p><hi rend="underline">or</hi>           <formula corresp="images/formulas/b1919_08_13_von_RussellBertrand_02.gif"/> </p> <p>&amp; I should have thought that from such props one could obtain a meaning for "there are at least 2 Gegenstände" → for you, "(∃x, y, φ) .φx . φy" would suffice. &amp; similar statements. There are things that puzzle me in this number &amp; the next.</p> <p>4.211. I gather no elementary prop is negative.</p> <p>4.51. It is necessary also to be given the prop that <hi rend="underline">all</hi> elementary props are given.</p> <p>5.15 This theory of probability seems to me right.</p> <p>5.3 All props results of truth-operations on elementary props? How about generality?</p> <p>5.453. No numbers in logic? why?</p> <p>5.53 seq. on identity. I agree with this. But the connection with the axiom of infinity seems dubious. See remark on 4.1272 above.</p> <p>6. "General truth-function: <formula corresp="images/formulas/b1919_08_13_von_RussellBertrand_03.gif"/>"</p> <p>Yes, this is <hi rend="underline">one</hi> way. But could one not do equally well by making <formula corresp="images/formulas/b1919_08_13_von_RussellBertrand_04.gif"/> mean "at least one value of ξ is false", just as one can do equally well with</p> <p>~p ∨ ~q &amp; with ~p . ~q as fundamental? I feel as if the duality of generality &amp; existence persisted covertly in your system.</p> <p>6.03. "General form of integer: [ 0, ξ, ξ + 1]". You only get finite ordinals. You deny classes, so cardinals collapse. What happens to ℵ<hi rend="subscript">0</hi>? If you said classes were superfluous in <hi rend="underline">logic</hi> I could imagine that I understood you, by supposing a distinction between logic &amp; mathematics; but when you say they are unnecessary in <hi rend="underline">mathematics</hi> I am puzzled. E.g. <hi rend="underline">something</hi> true is expressed by <formula corresp="images/formulas/b1919_08_13_von_RussellBertrand_05.gif"/>. How do you re-state this prop?</p> <p>6.123 seq. This is convincing to me.</p> <p rend="indent">I agree with what you say about induction, causality, etc.; at least, I can find no ground for disagreeing.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
