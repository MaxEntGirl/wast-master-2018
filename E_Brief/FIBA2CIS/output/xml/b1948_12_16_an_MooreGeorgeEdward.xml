But I'm also writing you this note: for two reasons. I had a letter &amp; Christmas card from Malcolm, &amp; he says that he hasn't yet heard from you. When I read this I thought of your telling me that you'd write to him; that was in October in your room when I mentioned the fact that he had complained to me about not hearing from you. And at the same time I thought of something else you promised me then, i.e, putting it into your will that my type-scripts, now in your possession, should, after your death, go to my executors, or to me if I should then be alive. ‒ This letter is to remind you of both matters, in case you have forgotten. You are in a position to give a <hi rend="underline">great</hi> deal of pleasure (in the first case) &amp; to avert a <hi rend="underline">great</hi> deal of distress (in the second) by comparatively simple means.</p> <p rend="indent">Rhees is coming here for 10 days next week. I am well &amp; working pretty hard. May you be well, too!</p> <p rend="indent">Forgive me this lengthy letter.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> <p rend="indent">P.S. I know it's a lot to ask it ‒ but if you could write me a line I'd be <hi rend="underline">very</hi> glad. The above address is my address.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
