I want to use the two days to look a little through the translation &amp; perhaps correct some of the worst mistakes. I havent yet had time to do this (queer as this may sound). My translator did about half of the first volume &amp; then had to leave for America where his father died some weeks ago. I'll also give you the German text â€’ in case it's any use to you. Not that I think that it's worth your while looking at it, or at the translation; but as you wish to see it of course you'll get it. (Moore has read most of the German text &amp; might possibly be able to give some information about it.) I'm afraid there's <hi rend="underline">only one</hi> copy of the English in existence &amp; only one <hi rend="underline">corrected</hi> copy of the German; you'll get these two copies.</p> <p rend="indent">Thanks ever so much for taking all this trouble (in what I believe to be a lost cause).</p> <p rend="indent">Yours ever</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
