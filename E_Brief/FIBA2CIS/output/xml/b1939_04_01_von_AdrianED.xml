As regards a London man, the only one I know is Dr. George Graham, 149 Harley St. W. </p> <p rend="indent">He has specialised in the subject for many years &amp; is a recognized authority – in fact the authority in the country. I should think his advice would be sound, for he must have had a very wide experience of diabetes. He comes up here to examine sometimes &amp; so would be in touch, probably, with the local doctors &amp; could tell them how to carry on. Graham must be a man of about 55 (he was here as a student). There are probably several younger men who specialise in diabetes, but I don’t know of any, &amp; although Graham is sound &amp; careful rather than brilliant &amp; ingenious I should think his advice would be good.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours sincerely </p> <p rend="indent">E D Adrian </p> </div> <div type="postscript" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"> <p rend="left">[AN PIERO SRAFFA]</p> <p rend="left">Dear Sraffa,</p> <p rend="indent">a) Note how intelligently this is written. b) Adrian, as you see, doesn’t recommend any Cambr. doctor for every day use. I therefore wrote to him again asking him whether he could do so or whether Dr. Graham should recommend a g.p. c) I had a letter from my eldest sister (you met in Vienna) yesterday sounding rather optimistic. She asks to give you her best wishes.</p> <p rend="indent">L.W.</p> </div> </div></body></text></TEI>
