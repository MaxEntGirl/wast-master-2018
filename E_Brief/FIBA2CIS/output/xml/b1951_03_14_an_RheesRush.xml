This is only to tell you that I've been feeling <hi rend="underline">very</hi> much better the last few days. I went for short walks yesterday &amp; the day before, &amp; they had no ill consequences. I imagine that this improvement is due to the x-ray treatment. ‒ The other day I saw in the New Statesman a review of a book which seems to be a collection of articles by various Logical Positivists: Wisdom, Ryle, Waisman, etc.. It particularly praised Waisman for a remark which comes <hi rend="underline">straight</hi> from me. Whenever I see an obvious theft I very much dislike it; although I really ought by now to be entirely used to it. I wish some reviewer would debunk these humbugs. ‒ The books I read recently were: "Studies in Classic American Literature" by D.H. Lawrence (Smythies lent it to me &amp; I <hi rend="underline">liked</hi> it, inspite of what seems to me lots of childishness &amp; immaturity), some Hamann (which is terribly difficult for me), "Moby Dick" (which I reread because of some of Lawrence's illuminating remarks ‒ &amp; I got more out of it the second time), bits of the Old Testament, "Rommel" by Brigadier Young (which I definitely like) ‒ So long ‒</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
