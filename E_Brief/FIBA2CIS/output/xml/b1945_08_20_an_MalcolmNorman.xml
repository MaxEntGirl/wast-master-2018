Wales</p> <p>Dear Norman,</p> <p rend="indent">Thanks for your letter of Aug. 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. Yes, I think I understand why a ship isn't a good place for 'thinking' ‒ I mean, <hi rend="underline">apart</hi> from the fact that you're very busy.</p> <p rend="indent">Perhaps I ought to feel elated because the war is over. But I'm not. I can't help feeling certain that this peace is only a truce. And the pretence that the complete stamping out of the 'aggressors' of this war will make this world a better place to live in, as a future war could, of course, only be started by them, stinks to high heaven &amp;, in fact, promises a horrid future.</p> <p rend="indent">After these cheering thoughts let me tell you that I'm having a fairly good holiday here &amp; that I'm feeling pretty stupid. Perhaps you'll say you've gathered as much from this letter already. ‒ Rhees sends you his kind regards. ‒ I hope you'll soon be demobilized &amp; that then we'll be able to have talks, not just writes. I'm glad you got "Hadshi Murat" &amp; I hope you'll get a lot out of it, because there is a lot <hi rend="underline">in</hi> it. I don't know any of the German books you mention but I'm suspicious about them ‒ because of their authors &amp; for other reasons. ‒ As I said: I hope you'll enjoy the Tolstoy. There's a <hi rend="doubleunderline">real</hi> man; who has a <hi rend="underline">right</hi> to write.</p> <p rend="indent">I had your mags 3 or 4 days ago &amp; immediately thanked you for them in a letter which I hope you'll receive soon. They're really grand.</p> <p rend="indent">So long! Good luck!</p> <p rend="indent">Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
