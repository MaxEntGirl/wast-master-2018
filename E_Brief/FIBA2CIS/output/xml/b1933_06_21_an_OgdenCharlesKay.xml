They mentioned in their letter certain corrections which Ramsey had made &amp; I had authorised &amp; asked whether I wished to make any further alterations. I replied on May 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> that I did not know what Ramseys corrections were &amp; that I wanted to see them before the new edition went into print. I then did not hear from Kegan Paul until today when they write to me, would I "be good enough to return to them the corrected proofs of Tractatus L-Ph... These are now required urgently". Now this obviously makes no sense as they haven't sent me any proofs &amp; some feeling warns me that they want to play a trick on me. So would you be so good to step in &amp; help clear up this matter.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours sincerely</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
