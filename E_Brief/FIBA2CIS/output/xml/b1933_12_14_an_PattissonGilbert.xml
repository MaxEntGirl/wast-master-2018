I think I need say no more. ‒ Meanwhile I have heard from Drury again. He has now got detailed information from Dublin &amp; it appears that the total cost of the training is £ 180 (only £ 10 more than we thought). Now what I should like to ask you is to lend him £ 20. This would cover the £ 10 just mentioned &amp; Drury's sister need then only give him £ 10.</p> <p rend="indent">To thank you for your kindness would, in a sense, be absurd, because you know what I <hi rend="underline">feel</hi>. (At least I hope you do.)</p> <p rend="indent">Gold, Gold, Gold, Gold, ad inf.</p> <p rend="indent">There is no hurry at all to send him the money as he can only matriculate at Dublin in April as it's too late for the October Term.</p> <p rend="indent">Marguerite wrote me that she would be free on Sunday Dec. 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I'm <hi rend="underline">sorry</hi> this means that I cann't spend a Saturday afternoon with you. I shall have to leave London either on Saturday 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> afternoon or on Friday 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. And from this it follows that I'll come to London either on Thursday 14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> or Friday 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> if you can spend one of the two evenings with me. When I'll have looked up the trains I shall let you know which of the two it is. But, please, if possible keep them free. Also arrange for good cinema programs &amp; good <hi rend="tripleunderline">Egg Nogs</hi>.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours bl.....y</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> <p rend="indent">I enclose a little picture which I've had in the Royal Academy last winter.</p> <p rend="indent">I have now found out about the trains. I shall leave London on Saturday &amp; come to London on Friday Dec. 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> some time in the afternoon if you can spend the evening with me.
