I needn't say the whole thing is absurd as he couldn't even make head or tail of it if it were translated very well. But as a matter of fact the translation is pretty awful as I saw today when I tried to go through it in order to correct it before giving it to Keynes. Though I worked quite hard on it the whole day with Smythies we only did 12 pages, because masses of it had to be altered. Tomorrow I must go on with it because tomorrow night Keynes ought to get it. So I'm afraid I shan't be able to come to you in the afternoon. I have written to Keynes that you have read the first half of my first volume &amp; could give him some information about it; for obviously you must be able to get more out of reading the original than Keynes could get out of a bad translation <hi rend="underline">&amp; in a hurry</hi>. So I <hi rend="underline">hope</hi> he'll ask you to give him your opinion. By the way, please don't mention to <hi rend="underline">anyone</hi> that I don't think highly of the translation. Rhees did his very best &amp; the stuff is damn difficult to translate.</p> <p rend="indent">I hope to see you soon. Best wishes!</p> <p rend="indent">Yours</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
