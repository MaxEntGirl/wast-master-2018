As I've said before, you should be put under tutilage! And in that case I might try to get 'powers of attorney'. (That's the sort of thing I always read in my detective magazines.) Everything in the box was most useful &amp; grand. ‒ Some weeks ago I heard from Norman who wrote that he hadn't yet heard from Prof. Moore. I think by now he'll have got a letter from him. ‒ You see, when I saw Moore 3 months ago I reminded him of <hi rend="underline">two</hi> things, one of which was to write to Norman. So when I heard that he hadn't written to Norman I thought he might also have forgotten his second promise to me &amp; I wrote him a letter with my Xmas card reminding him of <hi rend="underline">both</hi>; to which I received an answer from him, saying that he'd done both things. ‒ Rhees, whom you've met, is staying with me now for about a week. He is good company. I'm reading part of my stuff with him. When he leaves on Jan. 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> (tomorrow) I'll give him the tin of dried eggs from your parcel. I don't need it ju[s]t now &amp; he does. That reminds me: Your 'instant coffee' is lovely. I now see that Washington really was a great man ‒ I had a Christmas card &amp; a letter from Smythies. He seems to be well &amp; working <hi rend="underline">hard</hi>; I hope not <hi rend="underline">too</hi> hard. I, too, am working a fair amount &amp; still moderately well. I wish my luck could hold for another 6 months, for by then I could get a good chunk of work done. ‒ The weather here is cold now, <hi rend="underline">far</hi> too cold for my liking. ‒ Thanks again, &amp; thanks for the lovely card. All good wishes to you, Norman &amp; Ray from</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> <p rend="indent">I often think of you &amp; hope to see you all again before too long!</p> <p rend="indent">P.S. I had ordered for Norman a little book which, I thought, might interest him. Yesterday I found out from the <hi rend="underline">d....</hi> people in the bookshop that they hadn't given the publishers the right address! So heaven knows when it'll reach him! It's nothing anyhow, but I'm very sorry.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
