I had a rather <add status="unremarkable">nasty</add> cold lately, accompanied by stomach trouble; I’m afraid I was on the verge of seeing a doctor &amp; very worried about <hi rend="underline">that</hi>, but it cleared up by itself &amp; I’m almost as good as new again. I am, of course, <hi rend="underline">slightly</hi> liable to get infections these days, what with my blood not entirely up to scratch &amp; the chageable wintery weather. We had -15°C the other day, today it’s thonyling. But this isn’t a complaint. I’m very happy &amp; being treated very well. That’s all the news I know, except that Miss Anscombe is staying with very nice people &amp; learning German rapidly.</p> <p rend="indent">Thanks for writing to me about Ben Richards. He wrote to me how very kind you’d been. (As always!) He isn’t so much <hi rend="underline">afraid</hi> as <hi rend="underline">very</hi> shy &amp; <hi rend="underline">very</hi> repressed, particularly before he knows someone <hi rend="underline">well</hi>. – I <pb/>wish I knew how important it really is that he should get a job at <hi rend="underline">Barts</hi> . He seems to regard it as important. But I wish he could get out of London! I have an idea Barts isn’t good for him. I <hi rend="underline">don’t</hi> mean by this that he is in any danger of becoming superficial, or snobbish, or anything like that. There is no danger there. But I wish he could be with more simple &amp; more kindly people with whom he could open up, or he will get more &amp; more withdrawn.</p> <p rend="indent">Forgive me for blithering such a lot.</p> <p rend="indent">I’m looking forward to seeing you again. Thanks for everything!</p> </div> <div type="salute" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N"> <p rend="indent">Yours sincerely</p> <p rend="indent">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div> </div></body></text></TEI>
