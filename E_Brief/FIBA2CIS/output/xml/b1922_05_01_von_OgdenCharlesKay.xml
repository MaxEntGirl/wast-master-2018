I have been through half the notes, &amp; will finish them tomorrow. There will then be about a dozen places where we want to deviate verbally from your corrections, and will send these.</p> <p rend="indent">In the meantime, we are all agreed that it is a very great pity those <hi rend="underline">Ergänzungen</hi> are not there. <hi rend="doubleunderline">This is the first I have heard of them</hi> Russell said nothing about them, and Ostwald is clearly hopeless. If he had them he has lost them. <hi rend="underline">Doubtless your Vienna copy of which you spoke has them.</hi></p> <p rend="indent">Can you not send them to me [registered] <hi rend="underline">with</hi> basis of a translation if you can manage it, as your English is so good!</p> <p rend="indent">Any <hi rend="underline">typing</hi> at our expense, if you will let us have the account; it is easier for printers to read, but if Trattenbach has no "typists" dont risk the posts &amp; delay to Vienna but send in M.S. straight here. I look forward to them as early as possible.</p> <p rend="indent">The book is a little short as it is in any case; &amp; the supplements would be welcome quite apart from our desire to see &amp; print them for further elucidation.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours sincerely</p> <p rend="right">C. K. Ogden</p> <p rend="indent">P.S. You have taken away the <hi rend="underline">title</hi> from the first page With <hi rend="underline">no</hi> title either for the English or the German(?), and Russell's Introduction between the Preface (or at any rate the title-page) and N° 1 this will be very odd.</p> <p rend="indent">We can put Russell's Introduction <hi rend="underline">before your Preface</hi> &amp; put the title above the word Preface if you like; or do you mean to have only the German title on the <hi rend="underline">left-hand</hi> page?</p> <p rend="indent">P.S. The post office is closed &amp; I am sending this not registered as I shall write again tomorrow; but we should like the Supplements as soon as possible. I forgot to say that Johnson's <hi rend="underline">Logic</hi> Part I appeared last autumn (16/-) and Part II last week. (14/-)</p> <p rend="indent">Part III is promised for later.</p> <p rend="indent">It has been well "received" &amp; the old man is very pleased with himself. But apart from the suggestion in "Determinables" (Part I) &amp; "Distension" Magnitudes Part II, it does not deviate much from the traditional formal syllogistic matter.</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
