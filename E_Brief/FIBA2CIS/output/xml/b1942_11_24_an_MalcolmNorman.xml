I enclose a foul copy of a very wonderful German novel. I couldn't get a decent copy ‒ at least I had no time to look for a better one. German books, as you can imagine, are very difficult to get these days. You may find it rather difficult to read, &amp;, of course, you mayn't like it; but I hope you will. It's a sort of a Christmas present &amp; I hope you won't mind it being so dirty. The advantage of this is that you can read it down in the engine-room without making it <hi rend="underline">more</hi> dirty. If you find you like it I'll try to get you the book of which this is only one story. There are five of them called: "Züricher Novellen", because they're all in some way connected with Zürich: Keller was a Swiss, &amp; one of the greatest German prose writers. ‒ As I told you in my last letter I haven't heard from Smythies for ages &amp; have an idea that he has stopped being interested in me. But perhaps it isn't so. ‒ Wisdom is still in Cambridge. I never see him. ‒ Let me hear from you again. Bless you!! Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
