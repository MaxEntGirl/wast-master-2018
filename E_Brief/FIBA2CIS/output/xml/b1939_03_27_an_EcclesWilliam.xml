Yes, it's me. â€’ I should very much like to see you &amp;, curiously enough, I was talking to someone about you yesterday. I'ld like to come to you in the Easter vac, which is on now; but I think it'll probably be impossible. I'm waiting for my naturalisation to go through. I applied for it about 10 months ago &amp; it's due now. If I can get my (British) passport in a week or two from now I shall try to go to Vienna with it for a week or two to see my sisters who live there and are in a difficult &amp; <hi rend="underline">dangerous</hi> situation. For, although I can't really <hi rend="underline">help</hi> them they'll be glad to see me again.</p> <p rend="indent">Having got the professorship is very flattering &amp; all that but it might have been very much better for me to have got a job opening &amp; closing crossing gates. I don't get any kick out of my position (except what my vanity &amp; stupidity sometimes gets).</p> <p rend="indent">Well perhaps I can see you in the summer if not now. I'ld like to see your children too, particularly Hugh.</p> <p rend="indent">So long, &amp; thanks again for your letter. Please remember me to Mrs Eccles.</p> <p rend="indent">Yours ever</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig Wittgenstein</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
