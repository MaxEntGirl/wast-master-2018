I found Lee's &amp; your lovely Christmas parcel &amp; am enjoying it's contents. ‒ I had a letter from Oxford the other day, inviting me to give 6 lectures on philosophy. There are to be lectures of that sort every year by people outside Oxford. The lectures are called John Locke lectures &amp; I'd get £ 200 for them. I was told, however, that I'd have to expect a large audience, over 200 students, &amp; there mustn't be any discussion during the lectures. I haven't yet given them any definite answer but I think I'll reply in the negative. I don't think I can give formal lectures to a large audience that would be any good. ‒ I feel fairly well, though not quite as good as I did in Vienna, &amp; I'm <hi rend="underline">very</hi> dull &amp; stupid. In this state one shouldn't write letters but I wanted to thank Lee &amp; you for the Christmas parcel &amp; to wish you all a happy Easter. Give my love &amp; good wishes to anyone who has any use for them.</p> <p rend="indent">Affectionately</p> <p rend="right">Ludwig</p> <p rend="indent">I wish you &amp; I &amp; Doney could again have some discussions!</p> </div></body></text></TEI>
