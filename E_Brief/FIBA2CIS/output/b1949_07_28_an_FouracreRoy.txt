Dear Roy,
You haven't heard from me for a long time; not so much because I was too lazy to write, as because I was very busy & more or less ill. ‒ I came here 2 days ago. It's as hot as hell here but the heat, though disagreable, is doing me good. I'm staying with a former pupil of mine who is a professor at the University here. He & his wife are very nice & very kind to me. ‒ How are you? Have you found a new job. I often think of you, particularly because I often thought I might take up my old work at Guys or some such place, & now I'm such an old cripple that I couldn't possibly do the work I used to in the despensary lab. ‒ I'm doing my old work here, but at present not at all well because it's too damn hot. I've never had such heat in all my life. ‒ I intend to stay here about 3 months & then I'll probably come to London for some days & I hope to see you then. ‒ This place is about 8-9 hours by train west of New York, though it's in N.Y. state.
I shan't write any more today because I feel too stupid.
So long!
As always ‒
Ludwig
