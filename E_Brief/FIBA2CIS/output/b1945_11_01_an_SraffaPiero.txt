1.11. 
Dear Sraffa,
Various thoughts that went through my mind recently make me write this note. 
As you know, the way both you & I have developed in recent years makes it impossible for us to have profitable (or pleasant) conversations with oneanother. On the other hand neither of us has the slightest grudge against the other (in fact the opposite) & therefore I want you to know that, should there ever be any thing you wish to talk to me about, or that I can do for you, I shall be ever so glad to be of service to you. I know, of course, that such a case isnâ€™t likely to arrise: but you never know.
Please give my kind regards to your mother.
 Yours 
Ludwig Wittgenstein
