Text: 
Dear Gilbert, I'm sorry to hear that you've been ill & frightfully sorry you're not coming to Cambridge. I looked forward very much to seeing you. Perhaps I can get to London some time before term ends. ‒ Perhaps you wonder at this writing paper. Well it's something I've had specially made for my correspondence with distinguished people. Doesn't it look dignified? ‒ Thanks for the negatives & please accept the little retourn present I enclose. It is salt as found in the potatoemines of Messrs. Smith. Keep it well it may one day prove usefull to you. The splashes are excellent turkish coffe. Write to me from the sea side. Blodily yours
Ludwig
