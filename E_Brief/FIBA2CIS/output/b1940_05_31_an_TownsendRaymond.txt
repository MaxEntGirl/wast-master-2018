Dear Townsend,
A year or two ago a sister of mine visited me in Cambridge & brought with her some valuable musical manuscripts & some jewelery & gave them to me in order that I should keep them for members of my family which may one day need them. I deposited the things (two parcels) at my bank, Barklays Bank, Benet Street Cambridge & arranged for two people beside myself to be entitled to take them out of the bank. These two people are J.M. Keynes, the economist, & Piero Sraffa, a Fellow of my College of whom you might have heard. I have now decided to entitle you too to take out the stuff if anyone of my family should require it. My reason is this: I am not young, a foreigner, & therefore perhaps in some (though not great) danger, Keynes is old & ill, & Sraffa who is the ideal man for my purpose is an Italian & may be interned any day if Italy should enter the war. You are youngish &, comparatively, safe. I have given my bank your name & they now need a specimen of your signature, by which they'll be able to identify you. So please send me a slip of paper with your ordinary signature on it. ‒ I am in good bodily health but, as many people, find this time trying. Particularly the silly attitude (as it seems to me) of people I see. ‒ I hope you will not lose all contact with your friends. They may not be much use to you now & you may not be able to help them materially & yet there's a great point in not losing contact with them. If you should think that I'm a fool you might easily make a mistake. I wish you a lot of life.
So long!
Yours affectionately
Ludwig Wittgenstein
