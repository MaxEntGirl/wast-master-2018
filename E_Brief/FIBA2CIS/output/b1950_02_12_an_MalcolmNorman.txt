Dear Norman,
My eldest sister died yesterday. Her end was peaceful & no shock to us as we had expected it for some days. ‒ I intend to stay here for another month. I'm in very good health. So much so that I even had a fairly good discussion with Miss Anscombe a few days ago. I'd be more use to you now than I was last summer in Ithaca. ‒ I'm glad to hear that Lee expects a baby. I hope it won't be too difficult for Ray to get readjusted to the new situation; for in such a case the newcomer is apt to attract all affection & the older boy feels out in the cold, rightly or wrongly. Don't tell Ray about this remark which may have no application at all in his case. ‒ I can't say that Ryle's book worries me. Perhaps it ought to, but it doesn't. I was interested, however, in what you wrote about it. It tallied with what Smythies & Miss Anscombe told me. ‒ I should like to have discussions with you now. Still, one can't have everything.
Give my love to Lee & my good wishes to all those who don't mind getting them.
Affectionately
Ludwig
