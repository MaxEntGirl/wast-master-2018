My dear Townsend,
Thanks for your letter, dated August 11th. I was very glad to hear from you. I shall be in Cambridge for 5 or 6 days now. Could you come here? Possibly I'll be here right till term starts at the beginning of October. I feel terribly uncertain about my future & have a kind of longing to jump out of my own skin.
I am sorry to hear that you had a painful business before you left England.
Re neglecting ones friends, I think you perhaps slightly misunderstood me. I didn't doubt that if a friend called you & said he was in desperate need to see you you'ld make time to see him ‒ but, if you will only see your friends when they are in desperate need of you they won't call you even if they are. That's the point. One doesn't ask a man's help whom one never sees & of whom one only knows theoretically that in a great emergency he'ld come. Partly because an emergency isn't anything clearly defined. ‒
However I'm not going to philosophize about that.
I hope to see you soon.
Ever yours affectionately
Ludwig Wittgenstein
