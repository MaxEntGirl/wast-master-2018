Monday
Dear olde Bloode,
I cann't come to London, as originally planned â€’ on the 26th but a week later on Saturday October the 3rd. I'll arrive by the 19 00 = 7 p.m. train 1st Class only (Victoria) please meet me there if you can. If I don't find you at the station I'll wring up Argyll Rd to get further directions. Marguerite saw your photos the other day & liked them very much of course. I'll tell you the ones she should like to have copies of when we meet.
I'm looking forward to seeing your bloody face again!
Yours as usual
Ludwig
