Dear Sraffa,
Of course I know nothing about your plans – but I should like to know whether, by any chance, you intend to go to Czechoslovakia to help there in some way or other; & whether, if this is your intention, you would not mind having me with you, to do something.
You may ask a) “Why on earth do you think that I, Sraffa, could help in Cz.?” b) “Why on earth should I want you to come with me?” To both questions I answers: I don’t know; but it doesn’t seem to me impossible.
I am now on my way to Ireland; there my address will be: 
c./o. Drury 
36 Chelmsford Rd 
Ranelagh 
Dublin 
In case you should have any use for me I should be overjoyed, & in this case send a wire to the above address or both to this address & to 81 East Rd. I can join you say in Switzerland.
If my idea is phantastic, no harm’s done. 
Good wishes! 
Ludwig Wittgenstein
