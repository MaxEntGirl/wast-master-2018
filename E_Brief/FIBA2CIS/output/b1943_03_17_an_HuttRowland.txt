Dear Rowland,
I had your letter, dated 9th March, a week ago. I had 'flu & bronchitis these last few days & am still too weak to work. The trouble you wrote to me about reminded me of the trouble you had years ago at Woolworths. I imagine it's partly external, & partly internal. I mean, they mayn't be as decent with you as you deserve, ‒ but you tend to be unreliable. I.e. you tend to be alternately cold, warm, & lukewarm; & you mustn't be surprised if people sometimes disregard your periods of warmth & treat you as if you could be cold & lukewarm only.
I imagine that thinking a little more than you probably do would do you good. ‒ I hope your family isn't keeping you from thinking!? If anyone does they act very foolishly.
I should like to see you before long. I shall leave this hospital for good in less than 4 weeks' time & then go to Newcastle.
So long! Good wishes!
Ludwig
