Dear Wittgenstein,
I am sorry to trouble you with a publication detail. We expect the book will be ready now in a few weeks, but in English publishing there are various legal difficulties and I promised the publishers I would get something signed by you as to the 'Rights'.
The expenses of production have been rather heavy and if you would let me have the enclosed statement by return registered I should be very much obliged. We have one from Russell as far as he is concerned.
Russell and Mrs Russell are away at the sea in Cornwall, & having a splendid time. I hope he will soon get on to his book on "The Analysis of Matter." I am looking forward to going down to see them in July.
As soon as the book is ready I will send you a copy. May I send to anyone else a complimentary copy as "from the Author" (at our expense of course)?
Johnson
Keynes
[Bond]
Mauthner!
[Husserl?]
Ramsey
In haste
Yours sincerely
C. K. Ogden

I hereby give to Messrs Kegan Paul all publication rights of my "Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung" in consideration of their issuing it in German and English in the "International Library of Psychology & Philosophy" under the title Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus
