April 25. 1935. 
Miss Alice Ambrose has been attending my classes regularly since the beginning of the academical year 1932-33. I have been givin two courses of conversation classes entitled "Philosophy" and "Philosophy for Mathematicians". As my classes are very small I have been in a position to get to know her ability, her way of thinking and discussing, and general attitude towards the subject.
I am greatly impressed by her extraordinary seriousness and sincerity, and have found her indefatigable in trying to understand the extremely difficult problems we have been dis-cussing.
I am sure she will make a valuable, painstaking and patient teacher of philosophy, as she has acquired the rare capacity of seeing the extraordinary difficulty asnd complex-ity of philosophical problems.
Her ability for philosophical research is well above the average. The problem of mathematical finitism which she has set herself to investigate is a central problem of modern philosophy.
Miss Ambrose has been a most faithful and diligent student.
Ludwig Wittgenstein
