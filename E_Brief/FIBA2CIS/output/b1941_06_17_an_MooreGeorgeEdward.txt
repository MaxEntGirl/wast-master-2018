Dear Moore,
Thanks for your letter. Forgive if I have an entirely ungrounded fear. ‒ I was a fool to give you a wrong title: the poem is called "Das heilige Feuer" & it begins with the words "Auf das Feuer...". I'm sorry I caused you unnecessary trouble in looking for it.
Tim, as you know, has come to my classes this year & perhaps wrongly, I thought I saw an improvement in his thinking towards the end; he seemed to me to have become more lively & to get hold of the method ‒ touch wood! (I'ld rather you kept this entirely to yourself.)
About 6 weeks ago I suddenly ‒ for no reason I can imagine ‒ began to be able to write again. Quite possibly this will only last for a very short time; but it feels good while it lasts & has made a great deal of difference to me.
My very best wishes!
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
