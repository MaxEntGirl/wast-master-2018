Text: 
Dear Sraffa, 
I have been too exhausted to write out my letter to you in the last two weeks. This morning I did it (with a few alterations). On the other hand I think I ought not to come to tea with you but be in the open air all the afternoon, as I’ve got to lecture tomorrow & am pretty nearly at the end of my force. I cann’t do anything which at all strains me unnecessarily. I did not let you know before now as I intended to come to you, until this morning after writing the letter I felt that it wouldn’t be wise to do it. I’m going down next Saturday & I should want very much to see you before then, if it’s possible. I shall try to come to you next Friday at teatime to have a chat & say good bye. If this doesn’t suit you please let me know. 
Yours,
Ludwig Wittgenstein
