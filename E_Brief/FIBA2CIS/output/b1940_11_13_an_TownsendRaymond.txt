My dear Townsend,
I was very glad to get your letter. My health for the last 2 months or so has been all right; but my mind isn't functioning at all well. The causes are partly external partly internal. I'm not busy, I'm lazy & I'm stupid, & my thoughts are mainly turning round matters which they ought not to be turning around. My classes at the beginning of term went very badly; they have improved a bit lately. I haven't got a single really intelligent & serious pupil. It's a pretty awful class, some looking blasé, some sleepy. ‒ I'm taking a first-aid course now & I intend to take an exam at the beginning of December. It's rather likely that I shan't pass it & even if, I do that it won't be any use for me; but it might. ‒ I see very few people now-a-days, in fact too few, & it gets more difficult for me to make contact with people the older I get.
Let me hear from you again before long.
Yours affectionately
Ludwig Wittgenstein.
