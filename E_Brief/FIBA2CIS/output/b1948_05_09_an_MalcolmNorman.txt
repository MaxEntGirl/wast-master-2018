Dear Norman,
Thanks ever so much for your letter of May 9th. I hope that one day I shall be able to come & stay with you, & it's good to know that Lee & you will have me. Right now I must stay here & try to do moderately decent work. God alone knows if I'll succeed. I'm not a bit sanguine about it, but I still try & hope. ‒ By the time this letter reaches you you'll probably have heard that von Wright has been elected Professor at Cambridge. ‒ It's extraordinary that you can read the "Häsichenbraut", & not at all surprising that you find some of the dialects unintelligible. After all, if an Austrian peasant hears a North German speak he has the greatest difficulty to understand him, & if he heard a man speak in a Low German dialect (like that of "De Gaudeif un sin Meester") he wouldn't understand a single word. ‒ May your work go satisfactorily!!
Give my very best wishes to Lee & to Raymond.
As always, affecti[o]nately
Ludwig
There's one thing I'd be very grateful to you for sending me, i.e., a tin or glass of some powdered coffee extract, like "Nescafe", or one made by a Firm Borden. Lee will know what I mean. But do it only if it's very easy for you.
