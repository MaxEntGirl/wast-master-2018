My dear Watson,
Thanks so much for your kind letter, dated July 3rd. Mrs Wisdom and her son are both going over to Canada, so Wisdom writes me, but he doesn’t write the date of their departure. Mrs Wisdom will try to see you when she arrives at Montreal. I hope this won’t cause you too much trouble, or at least no unpleasant trouble.
I have a lot of M.S.S. here, in fact all my research of the last 10 years, none of which has been published. – About 21/2 years ago I gave all my M.S.S. to Trinity College and most of them are at present in the college library. How safe they are there God only knows. The best thing now is to feel fatalistic about all these things. Your idea of sending the M.S.S. over to Canada is good, but, somehow, I don’t think I’ll do it. It’s all a gamble.
This time has a very queer effect on one’s nerves and on one’s thinking. I hope whatever happens I’ll act moderately decently.
I wish you lots of good luck!!
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
