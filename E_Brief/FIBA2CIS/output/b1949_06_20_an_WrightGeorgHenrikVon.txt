Dear v. Wright,
Thanks for your letter. I'm glad to say that I got much better in the last 3-4 days. I'm sorry Miss Deutsch can't give me more time. It means that I'll have to try to get someone else, either besides her, or instead of her. I used to dictate to a typist in Huntingdon Rd. who was pretty efficient though personally not very agreable. Trouble is ‒ I don't remember her name, only the house in which she lived (& not even the number). So, when I get to Cambridge, I'll look her up. If you heard of anyone who can type German well it would of course be grand, but that's most unlikely. Don't bother about it. ‒ I shall w[r]ite day & time of my arrival.
Looking forward to seeing you soon.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
