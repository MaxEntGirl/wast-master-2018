Dear Norman, Dear Lee,
You must have wondered why I didn't write to you for such a long time. Unfortunately I fell ill when I arrived here 10 days ago (some kind of flu). I'm better now, but still far from well. So, please forgive me if I don't write more than a few lines today. Thanks for all your great kindness! I wish I could have been a better guest.
I am staying with Mrs Rhees, who is very kind to me, until Wednesday. Then I'll probably go to Cambridge for a few days & after that to Dublin. Please send all my mail to Ross's Hotel
Parkgate Street
Dublin Eire.
Give my good wishes to Doney.
Thanks again.
Affectionately
Ludwig
