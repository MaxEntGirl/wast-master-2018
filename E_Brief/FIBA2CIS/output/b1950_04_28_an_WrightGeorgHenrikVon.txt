Dear von Wright,
Thank you very much indeed for the Grimm. When the parcel from Deighton Bell arrived I was sure at first that it must have been sent to me by mistake as I had never ordered any books; but when I opened it I had a very pleasant surprise & I enjoy reading in the books. â€’ The above address is where I live. I don't yet feel acclimatized at all. The house isn't very noisy but not very quiet, either. I don't know yet how I shall get on. The lodgers seem all to be rather nice, & one of them even very nice.
Thanks again! Give my good wishes to everybody.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
