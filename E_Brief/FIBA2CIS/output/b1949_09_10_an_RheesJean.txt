Dear Mrs Rhees,
I am sailing on Oct. 21st from New York to Southampton on the Queen Elizabeth. I don't know exactly when she arrives at Southampton but I imagine somewhere about the 27th. I should be very grateful to you if you could put me up then for a few days. ‒ I've been ill, or illish most of the time I spent here & I'm still exceedingly weak. So I'll be rather a nuisance. If you can't put me up, please send me a wire to Southampton. I'm travelling 3rd class.
I hope to see you soon. So long!
Ludwig Wittgenstein
