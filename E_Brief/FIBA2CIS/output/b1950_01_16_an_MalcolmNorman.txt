Dear Norman,
Thanks for your letter of Dec. 26th. I am very well indeed now & am anything but depressed. I've had no end of luck. Even that Dr Mooney did not recognize my illness was very lucky. Give her my love, please. ‒ My brain works very sluggishly these days but I can't say I mind. I'm reading various odds & ends, e.g. Goethes Theory of colour which, with all its absurdities, has very interesting points & stimulates me to think. ‒ I'm sorry you had trouble with the parcel you sent me. It'll teach Lee though not to give me such a lot of good things! At least I hope it will. I'm overeating shamefully as it is & getting more & more fat. ‒ I wish I could again have discussions with you, Doney, & Nelson. Give them my good wishes. If we could meet you'd find me pretty slow & stupid; I've only got very few 'lucid moments'. I'm not writing at all because my thoughts never sufficiently crystallize. Not that it matters.
Give my love & thanks to Lee. As always, affectionately
Ludwig
Tell Doney, his Christmas card wasn't soupy enough.
