Text: 
Dear Wisdom,
Thanks for your letter. I want to make two remarks. 1) I believe that all you say is honest & true; but I don’t believe that it’s the whole truth. I think there’s something most essential which you haven’t said, because you weren’t aware of it. You could become aware of it if you asked yourself the question: would you have thought of broadcasting the fact that you had been bored if not I but Dr. Broad had bored you? - I believe that the true answer to this question is a clue to the whole business
2) If you say that it’s an exageration to call Joad’s paper a ‘rotten attack’ it certainly is not an exageration in the sense that I overstated my feelings or that I worked myself up into violent indignation. The words ‘rotten attack’ were a very short but rather a mild expression of my opinion of Joad’s paper, which I believe to be foul, from beginning to end - I will not say more about this because it would be useless.
Thank you again for your letter. I know you mean well, & may you not one day give up meaning well.
Yours 
Ludwig Wittgenstein 
I wish to make one more remark: I should like to have you as a friend in this departement; but only if it can be done by being frank with you, & by not hiding disapproval where I strongly feel it.
