Dear Roy,
Please forgive me for not writing such a long time. Your letter arrived while I was in Norway where I stayed 5 weeks in October & November. Then I fell ill & haven't quite recovered yet. At the end of December I plan to go to Norway again, not for holidays but for work. I hope it will be possible. ‒ I wonder what the good news are you wrote about. I suppose it isn't that they are errecting a huge statue of me in front of Nuffield house. Or is it? Of course, no monument of stone could really show what a wonderful person I am. ‒ I hope you get some holidays at Christmas & I hope I'll see you before I go. Just now my movements are uncertain because I'm not quite well. I'll let you know what happens to me.
So long! & bless you.
Ludwig
