Trin. Coll. 30.10
My dear Watson,
The other day I found your full address written on a bit of paper which I could not find when I answered your letter during the vac. I then simply wrote to McGill University Canada and so probably my letter hasn't reached you. I enjoyed the cutting from John O'London's Weekly very much. - I am not lecturing this year, only giving an informal discussion class once a week in my new rooms. This is because I am very busy with my own work. Almost all our friends have gone down and I see very few people - which however I don't regret. Drury is still up and I'm glad he is. - I hope to publish something in less than a year's time. -
Prof. Hardy the Mathematician who was lecturer here when I was an undergraduate and then whent to Oxford has now come back here as a Prof. and is one of the few people I see. I like him very much. The other day I met Priesdey (another excellent man) and we talked of you. - I hope you're well, let me hear from you and your life and send me nonsensical articles if you come across any.
Yours ever
Ludwig Wittgenstein
