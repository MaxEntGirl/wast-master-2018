Dear Miss Ambrose,
I still feel very uncertain about tomorrow but I don't want to put you off & I want to make you a proposal: Could you come at 9.30 as usual & bring some work along with you, perfectly prepared just to work on quietly in case I find that I can't dictate or explain. I say, bring some work along, because reading my german M.S. isn't quite the right thing; it's only a makeshift, for you can't properly understand it without spending lots of time on it, & also the thought that you are reading it & puzzled by it makes me feel sort of nervous when I sit there. If I have proposed something which you don't quite like, please don't do it for me. On the other hand, if you like doing it this way I should be very pleased.
Yours very sincerely
Ludwig Wittgenstein
