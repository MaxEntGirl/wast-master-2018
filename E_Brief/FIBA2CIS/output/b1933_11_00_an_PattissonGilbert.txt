 Schmetterlingsbild   I consider this pretty good!
My dear Gilbert,
The train actually starts only at 11.15 (but you were virtually wrong for the timetable has been changed quite recently). So I had heeps of time to write to Drury. Please let him know Claytons exact address. I looked it up in the telephon d[i]rectory but found one contradicting the one you gave me. I also want to say, which however is almost superfluous, that I enjoied yesterday hugely. I hope you weren't too? tired afterwards. When saying good by to you I felt that you were afraid of my making a little speech. But did I? ‒ Oh old God! ‒ Thanks again for everything. ‒ And by the way take the Sedobrol it's really excellent stuff & entirely harmless. It is not a sleeping drug but only an extreemely mild seditive & one doesnt get accustomed to it. You may absolutely rely on what I say (in this respect) Old God ‒ 
Yours
Ludwig
I'm afraid I couldnt bring my silver writing pad with me as I should have to pay to heavy duty on it
