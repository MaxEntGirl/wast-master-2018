Dear Roy,
The letter you sent off to America reached me here yesterday. I was very sorry to hear about all your trouble. Just before leaving England a fortnight ago I sent you a Chrismas card with a letter to your old address. I hope they'll forward it to you. Please see to it that they do. I hope your wife is better now & that you find your new flat moderately convenient. ‒ I intend to stay here for a couple of months & then to return to England. ‒ My health is still very wobbly. I want to see you when I come back & have a long chat with you ‒ preferrably at the Strand Corner House. ‒ Give Miss Wilkinson my good wishes; I think I forgot to write her a Christmas card, I'm sorry.
I'm looking forward to seeing you. ‒ God bless you.
As always,
Ludwig
