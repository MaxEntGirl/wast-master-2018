Dear Mr Mulkerrin,
I intend to come to Rosro to stay there on Friday the week after next, April 23rd. Please have the cottage ready. I don't know yet what time I shall arrive but I shall try to get there about midday if that's possible. I shall stay in Galway for a night & I'll buy some supplies there, but please get me 2 pints milk & some eggs. Dr Drury told me that you would help me & look after me, I hope you will.
I am looking forward to seeing Rosro again after so many years.
Yours sincerely
L. Wittgenstein
