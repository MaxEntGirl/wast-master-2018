Dear old Beast,
This is just to let you know that I'm alive although afflicted with a bloody cold which wont leave me. I want to know, roughly, how you are & what the photos have turned out to be like. If they aren't either entirely white ore entirely black i.e. if anything can be seen on them at all please let me have a coppy of each. I enclose a Thought For The Week which may prove usefull to you. It comes from "John O'Londons Weekly", which seems to be full of such gems. My address is:
Dr L. W. Hochreith,
Post Hohenberg
Nieder-Ã–sterreich
Austria.
I remain yours bl.
Ludwig
