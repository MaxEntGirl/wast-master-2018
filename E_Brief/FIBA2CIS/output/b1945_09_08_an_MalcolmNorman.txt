Dear Norman,
You're terrific! ‒ Thanks a lot for the mags. It's nice getting a parcel from you, not only because of its contents.
The one way in which the ending of Lend-Lease really hits me is by producing a shortage of detective mags in this country. I can only hope Lord Keynes will make this quite clear in Washington. For I say: if the U.S.A. won't give us detective mags we can't give them philosophy, & so America will be the looser in the end. See? ‒ I'm still in Swansea & enjoying my absence from Cambridge. My work isn't going well; partly because I've contracted some trouble with one of my kidneys. Nothing serious, but it makes me jumpy & bad tempered. (I've always got some excuse.) ‒ The other day I read Johnson's 'Life of Pope' & liked it very much. As soon as I get to Cambridge I'm going to send you a little book "Prayers & Meditations" by Johnson. You may not like it at all, ‒ on the other hand you may. I do.
This is all for now. Most of this page & the next page I will leave free in case you want to make any notes. I hope to see you before long! Good luck! Thanks again!
Affectionately
Ludwig
