Saturday
Dear Gilbert,
In the article on Gold in Encyclopaedia Britannica (14th Edition) I find the following remark: "On account of its brilliant appearance, unalterability, & occurrence in the native condition, Gold was almost certainly the first metal to attract the attention of man." I think I need say no more. ‒ Meanwhile I have heard from Drury again. He has now got detailed information from Dublin & it appears that the total cost of the training is £ 180 (only £ 10 more than we thought). Now what I should like to ask you is to lend him £ 20. This would cover the £ 10 just mentioned & Drury's sister need then only give him £ 10.
To thank you for your kindness would, in a sense, be absurd, because you know what I feel. (At least I hope you do.)
Gold, Gold, Gold, Gold, ad inf.
There is no hurry at all to send him the money as he can only matriculate at Dublin in April as it's too late for the October Term.
Marguerite wrote me that she would be free on Sunday Dec. 17th I'm sorry this means that I cann't spend a Saturday afternoon with you. I shall have to leave London either on Saturday 16th afternoon or on Friday 15th. And from this it follows that I'll come to London either on Thursday 14th or Friday 15th if you can spend one of the two evenings with me. When I'll have looked up the trains I shall let you know which of the two it is. But, please, if possible keep them free. Also arrange for good cinema programs & good Egg Nogs.
Yours bl.....y
Ludwig
I enclose a little picture which I've had in the Royal Academy last winter.
I have now found out about the trains. I shall leave London on Saturday & come to London on Friday Dec. 15th some time in the afternoon if you can spend the evening with me. Please let me know if you can.
Ludwig
