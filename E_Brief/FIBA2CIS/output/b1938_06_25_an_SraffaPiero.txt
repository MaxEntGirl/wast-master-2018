Dear Sraffa,
I enclose a very discouraging letter from my solicitor which came this morning. Do you think I ought to ask him whether there is any way of speeding up the proceedings? I don’t think so: It’s probably quite impossible & I’ll have to be grateful for what’s been done already, this is, I suppose, what he wishes to tell me. In my letter to the solicitor I left out the passage about having ‘serious reasons’ etc. entirely, owing to your criticism. I wonder now whether leaving this out was wise. 
I had a letter form Pattisson yesterday saying that I have still approximately 300 £ with him. He writes that he’s had lots of personal worry lately & so didn’t feel like writing. – 
Well, so long!
Yours 
Ludwig Wittgenstein
I wonder whether I should write another letter to the solicitor saying what my reasons are for wishing the business to go through as quickly as possible.
