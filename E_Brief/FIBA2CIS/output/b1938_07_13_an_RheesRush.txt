Dear Rhees,
I'm sure you'll think me a beast for changing my mind again about attending that bl... congress. But the truth is, I'm glad I have changed my mind. It was an awful thought to go & sit there among logical positivists & the like; even your presence couldn't make up for all the nastiness. I couldn't however make up my mind not to go until this morning I had an idea which I can't very easily explain to you in writing. The gist of it is that I am thinking of publishing something before long after all so as to end the constant misunderstandings & misinterpretations. I very much want to talk the business over with you. Please forgive my fickleness or, at any rate, suspend your judgement until you've had another talk with me.
I hope very much to see you before long.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
