My dear Malcolm,
Thanks for your letter da[ted] May 31st & for the 1 1/2d. They'll come in very handy. Congratulations to your Ph.D.! And now: may you make good use of it! By that I mean: may you not cheat either yourself or your students. Because, unless I'm very much mistaken, that's what will be expected from you. And it will be very difficult not to do it, & perhaps impossible; & in this case: may you have the strength to quit.
This ends today's sermon. ‒ I've had a good deal of worry lately as Skinner, about a month ago, fell ill with something called 'glandular fever' of which he's only now recovering slowly. ‒ I saw Moore the other day & his healt[h] is all right & he is in quite good spirits. ‒ I have found it almost impossible to work for many weeks, & I have therefore arranged with Lewy that I'ld give him every day an hour or two of talk on the foundations of maths & similar subjects. It doesn't do him any harm & it helps me & seems to be the only way just now to get my brain moving a little. It's a shame ‒ but there it is. ‒ Smythies has gone down & I don't know exactly where he is but I hope to hear from him soon.
May I not prove too much of a skunk when I shall be tried.
I wish you good not necessarily clever thoughts, & decency that won't come out in the wash.
Affectionately
Ludwig Wittgenstein
If Skinner knew that I was writing to you I know he'ld like me to send you his best wishes, so here they are: ........................ .
