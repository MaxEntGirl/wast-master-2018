Dear von Wright,
Thanks for your letter. I have been rather ill for the last month, or so, & though I'd like to see you, it wouldn't be worth your while to come to Oxford. All the more as I shall, in all likelihood, come to Cambridge sometime next week. I'll stay with Dr Bevan & will let you know when I'm there. The last few days I've been feeling pretty good, but I still stay in bed for part of the day.
I'm looking forward to seeing you.
Yours
Ludwig Wittgenstein
