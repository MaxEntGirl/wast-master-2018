Text: 
Dear Russell,
Still in the motorcar to Penzance I thought of a notation I have used in my M.S. which you cann't possibly understand as ‒ I believe ‒ it's explanned nowhere: I use the sign II'. Now first of all I must say that where you find two capital I like this II this means π for I had no π on my typewriter. Now π' is a prescription, derived from the prescription π (i.e. the prescription according to which we develop the decimal extension of π) by some such rule as the following: "whenever you meat a 7 in the decimal extension of π, replace it by a 3" or "whenever you get to three 5s in that extension replace them by 2" etc. In my original M.S. I denoted this sort of thing by  and I'm not sure whether I haven't used this sign in a place of my typewritten M.S. to. ‒ Of course there are probably lots & lots of such details which make the paper uninteligible, quite appart from the fact that it is unintelligible in any case.
Another instance occurs to me just now: When I write "" I mean π develloped to 4 places in some given system, say, the decimal system. Thus   in the decimal system. I cann't think of anything else to write in the moment. I feel depressed & terribly mudled in my head which is partly due to the Cambridge climat which it allways takes me several days to get accustomed to. I feel there must be allmost as many faults as words in this letter, but I cann't help it.
Yours ever
L Wittgenstein
