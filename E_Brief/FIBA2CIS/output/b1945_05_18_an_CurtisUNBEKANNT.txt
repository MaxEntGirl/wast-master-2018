Dear Miss Curtis,
Mrs G.E.M. Geach has attended my classes on philosophy for four terms. As the number of my students is small & as I have discussion with them both in & outside my classes I have been able to form a definite impression of Mrs Geach’s philosophical abilities.
She is, undoubtedly, the most talented female student I have had since 1930, when I began lecturing; & among my male students only 8 or 10 have either equaled or surpassed her. She has an excellent grasp of philosophical problems, great seriousness, & ability for hard work. I should like to recommend her most warmly for a Research Fellowship.
I believe that the subject which she proposes to work on is very well suited to her particular turn of mind.
The two essays she has sent in, though they definitely show a good soil for growing philosophical thoughts, are still very immature. This, however, ought not, in my opinion, to weigh against her. It is the unavoidable consequence of her having been subjected, on coming to Cambridge, to new philosophical influences which she has not had the time to digest. This process will take much hard work & can’t be hurried - There is very good reason to expect that she will produce sound & interesting work in philosophy. I, therefore, wish to repeat that I recommend her most warmly.
Yours sincerely, 
Ludwig Wittgenstein 
[great variety of philos. subjects 
sincerity 
excellent teacher & explains herself in clear & simple language 
always ready to consider other peoples difficulties seriously, patient impressive 
character]
