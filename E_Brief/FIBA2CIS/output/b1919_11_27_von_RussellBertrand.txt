Dear Wittgenstein
I have my passport & visa; I informed the authorities that my business was to see you. I suggest your arriving Dec. 11, as I am not quite sure what day I shall get away. I will buy your furniture from you, which will pay your expenses. I don't know where I shall stay, but will have a letter at Poste Restante addressed to you, to say where I am staying, if you arrive after me. If you arrive first, you can do the same. I can't tell how much I look forward to seeing you â€’ you have been in my thoughts so much all through this long time.
Yours ever
Bertrand Russell.
