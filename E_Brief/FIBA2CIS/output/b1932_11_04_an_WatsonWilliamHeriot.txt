My dear Watson,
Thanks so much for your letter dated Sept. 2nd and please forgive me for not writing to you sooner. I had however lots of work and lots of trouble personal and otherwise which prevented me. The cuttings were excellent! – In a week or two Jeans is giving a lecture on the “Furthest depths of the universe”. I had an invitation to go but I thought I’d better stay away. – I’m giving more lectures (or rather discussions) now than usual. 4 hours a week, one hour being a special course for mathematicians. My audience is rather poor – not in quantity but in quality. I’m sure they don’t get anything from it and this rather worries me. Moore is still coming to my classes which is a comfort. My own work is progressing slowly. I have had news from Drury and Townsend lately. Drury is in South Wales doing work to help the unemployed. He is as excellent as ever. Townsend is teaching in a school. I will now close the letter which isn’t really a letter at all but I feel in the very worst condition for writing. What with flu, bad pupils and rotten weather I’m inclined to feel a bit depressed at times. However this will all pass over. Please write again soon. I’m always awfully glad to hear from you. But I’m a bl . . . correspondent myself.
Yours ever
Ludwig Wittgenstein
