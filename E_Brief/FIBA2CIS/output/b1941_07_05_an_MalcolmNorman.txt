Dear Malcolm,
I got your letter dated May 17th yesterday. It's always good to hear from you! I am sorry ‒ honestly ‒ that you find you won't be able to teach at Princeton after next year. You know what my opinion of teaching philosophy is & I haven't changed it; but I'ld like you to quit for the right reasons, not for the wrong ones x ('right' & 'wrong' as I can see it x). I know you'll make a good soldier; still, I hope you won't have to be one. I wish you could live quiet, in a sense, & be in a position to be kind & understandig to all sorts of human beings who need it! Because we all need this sort of thing very badly. The mags arrived a few weeks ago & I immediately thanked you for them. They were really grand! ‒ Skinner sends his regards & Smythies will, when he hears from me. I wish I could dine with you before long! Lots of good wishes!
Affectionately
Ludwig Wittgenstein
